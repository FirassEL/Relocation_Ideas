    "supplementary_information": "Background\n\n    This rule makes a change to Item 33 of the Schedule of Fees by \nadding a $1 fee to register for the DV lottery in addition to the $330 \nDiversity Visa Application fee. The cost of managing the DV lottery \nhistorically has been included in the Diversity Visa Application fee as \nauthorized by law. See 8 U.S.C. 1153 (note) (noting that the Diversity \nVisa Application fee ``may be set at a level that will ensure recovery \nof the cost to the Department of State of allocating visas under such \nsection, including the cost of processing all applications \nthereunder''). By creating a new fee for the lottery registration, the \nDepartment will more fairly put the cost of managing the lottery on \nthose who register for it. This change will also help to reduce \nspecious registrations by actors seeking to exploit unsuspecting \npotential entrants.\n    To effect this change to the DV program, the Department is also \namending 22 CFR 42.33(b)(3) by deleting the following sentence: ``No \nfee will be collected at the time of submission of a petition, but a \nprocessing fee may be collected at a later date, as provided in \nparagraph (i) of this section.'' In addition, the Department is \namending 22 CFR 42.33(i) to note that a registration fee will be \ncollected through an authorized U.S. Government payment portal at the \ntime of registration, prior to submission and completion of the \nregistration.\n\nWhat is the authority for this action?\n\n    Sec. 636 of Public Law 104-208, div. C, Title VI, 110 Stat. 3009-\n703, reproduced at 8 U.S.C. 1153 (note), authorizes the Secretary of \nState to collect and retain a ``Diversity Immigrant Lottery Fee.'' \nUnder this fee authority, the Secretary of State may establish and \nretain a fee to recover the costs of ``allocating visas'' described in \n8 U.S.C. 1153, i.e., running the DV lottery pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \n1154(a)(1)(I), and to recover the costs of ``processing applications'' \nfor diversity immigrant visas submitted by selectees of the lottery. \nPer the authority, the Department is permitted but not required to \nbuild the costs of running the lottery into the DV application fee. The \nDV application fee was last adjusted in 2012, when it was lowered from \n$440 to $330.\n    In addition to the specific DV application fee authority, the \nDepartment derives the general authority to establish cost-based \nconsular fees from the general user charges statute, 31 U.S.C. 9701. \nSee, e.g., 31 U.S.C. 9701(b)(2)(A) (``The head of each agency . . . may \nprescribe regulations establishing the charge for a service or thing of \nvalue provided by the agency . . . based on . . . the costs to the \ngovernment.''). The President also has the power to set the amount of \nfees to be charged for consular services provided at U.S. embassies and \nconsulates abroad pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 4219, and has delegated this \nauthority to the Secretary of State, E.O. 10718 (June\n\n[[Page 44525]]\n\n27, 1957). The Department is relying on these authorities to establish \nthis fee to register for the DV lottery, and is shifting the costs of \nrunning the lottery from the DV application fee to the $1 lottery \nregistration fee.\n    In the absence of a specific statutory fee retention authority, \nfees collected for consular services must be deposited into the general \nfund of the Treasury pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3302(b).\n\nWhy is the Department adjusting fees at this time?\n\n    The Department is creating a $1 fee to register for the DV lottery \nprogram. This $1 fee reflects the operational costs of running the \nannual DV lottery. These include the annual review and update of the \nsystems required to collect the lottery form submissions, data storage, \nautomated randomized selection of lottery winners, and associated \nsecurity reviews. The Diversity Visa application fee will continue to \ncover all other costs associated with administering the Diversity Visa \nprogram. The costs associated with the lottery that are currently \nincluded in the DV application fee would be removed from that fee, but \nthe overall cost per accepted applicant is low enough that the DV fee \nwould not be immediately reduced. The Department reviews consular fees \nperiodically, including through an annual update to its Cost of Service \nModel, to determine appropriateness of each fee consistent with OMB \nguidance. The Department will review the DV fee in its next model \nupdate and adjust the DV application fee if and as needed at that time.\n    Separating the DV lottery process from the DV application process \nmore fairly places the cost burden of the lottery registration on \nindividuals who seek the benefit of gaining access to the DV lottery \ninstead of charging the small percentage of successful registrants for \nthe increased costs associated with administering the program for all \nregistrants. With certain exceptions--such as the reciprocal \nnonimmigrant visa issuance fee--the Department generally sets consular \nfees at an amount calculated to achieve recovery of the costs to the \nU.S. government of providing the consular service, in a manner \nconsistent with general user charges principles, regardless of the \nspecific statutory authority under which the fees are authorized. As \nset forth in OMB Circular A-25, as a general policy, each recipient \nshould pay a reasonable user charge for government services, resources, \nor goods from which he or she derives a special benefit, at an amount \nsufficient for the U.S. government to recover the full costs to it of \nproviding the service, resource, or good. See OMB Circular No. A-25, \nsec. 6(a)(2)(a). The OMB guidance covers all Federal Executive Branch \nactivities that convey special benefits to recipients beyond those that \naccrue to the general public. See id., sections 4(a), 6(a)(1).\n\nWhen will the Department of State implement this rule?\n\n    The Department intends to implement this rule 30 days after date of \npublication.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department asserts the ``foreign affairs function'' exemption \nto the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). This is \nconsistent with the Attorney General's opinion \\1\\ that was issued \nconcurrent with the passage of the APA that\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure \nAct. (1947). United States: U.S. Department of Justice, pp. 26-27.\n\n    It is equally clear that the exemption is not limited to \nstrictly diplomatic functions, because the phrase ``diplomatic \nfunction'' was employed in the January 6, 1945 draft of S. 7 (Senate \nComparative Print of June 1945, p. 6; Sen. Doc. p. 157) and was \ndiscarded in favor of the broader and more generic phrase ``foreign \naffairs function''. In the light of this legislative history, it \nwould seem clear that the exception must be construed as applicable \nto most functions of the State Department and to the foreign affairs \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfunctions of any other agency. (emphasis added)\n\n    The subject matter of this final rule involves the collection of \nvisa fees through the Diversity Visa program. The administration of \nthis program is a foreign affairs function of the United States.\n    By requiring the $1 fee for all aliens who register for the \nDiversity Visa program, the Department is shifting the burden of the \nregistration and random selection process to the group that seeks the \nbenefit of gaining access to the program, instead of only charging the \nsmall percentage of successful registrants, who will still be \nresponsible for the costs associated with administering the remainder \nof the program. This is a fairer way to administer the DV visa program. \nVisas are issued by the Department of State to foreign citizens in \nforeign countries. Accordingly, this rule is properly viewed as one \nthat ``clearly and directly involve[s] activities or actions \ncharacteristic to the conduct of international relations.'' Capital \nArea Immigrants' Rights Coal. v. Trump, 471 F. Supp. 3d 25, 53 (D.D.C. \n2020); E.B. v. U.S. Dep't of State, 583 F. Supp. 3d 58, 64 (D.D.C. \n2022). The D.C. Circuit likely would apply this test as well, as that \ncourt has adopted a direct-involvement test for the analogous benefits \nexception contained in the same subsection of the APA. Crafting visa \npolicy for the United States is inherently a foreign affairs function \nunder any test.\n    In addition, although the text of the Administrative Procedure Act \ndoes not require an agency invoking this exemption to show that such \nprocedures may result in ``definitely undesirable international \nconsequences,'' some courts have required such a showing. E.g., Yassini \nv. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1360 n.4 (9th Cir. 1980). As noted above, \nthe collection of this fee is intended in part to help to reduce \nspecious registrations by actors seeking to exploit unsuspecting \npotential entrants. Because the publication of this rule for notice and \ncomment would provide opportunity for such actors to modify their \nmethods prior to the first DV registration in which the fee will be \nimplemented, such publication would more than likely result in such \nundesirable international consequences. Accordingly, the promulgation \nof a fee to be collected at the time of registration for the DV program \ninvolves an inherently foreign affairs function of the Department of \nState.\n    In addition, consistent with his statutory authority,\\2\\ the \nSecretary of State has determined that all policy related to visa \noperations and issuance, among other matters, constitutes a foreign \naffairs function of the United States under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553).\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ 22 U.S.C. 2656.\n    \\3\\ See Determination: Foreign Affairs Function of the United \nStates, 90 FR 12200 (Mar. 14, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    This rule would not regulate ``small entities'' as that term is \ndefined in 5 U.S.C. 601(6) and as such would not have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The \nDepartment affirms that this proposed rule will not have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in \n5 U.S.C. 601(6).\n\nUnfunded Mandates Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not result in the expenditure by state, local, and \ntribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 \nmillion or more in any year, and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the\n\n[[Page 44526]]\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1501-1504.\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\n\nExecutive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and Executive \nOrder 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)\n\n    The Department has reviewed this rule to ensure its consistency \nwith the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in the \nExecutive Orders. OMB has determined that this rule is not significant \nunder Executive Order 12866.\n    The Department is establishing this fee in accordance with 31 \nU.S.C. 9701 and OMB Circular A-25, as described in more detail above. \nSee, e.g., 31 U.S.C. 9701(b)(2)(A) (``The head of each agency . . . may \nprescribe regulations establishing the charge for a service or thing of \nvalue provided by the agency . . . based on . . . the costs to the \nGovernment.'').\n    Details of the proposed fee change are as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                     Estimated annual   Estimated change\n                     Item No.                        Proposed fee     Current fee    Change in fee    Percentage        number of        in annual fees\n                                                                                                       increase      applications \\1\\    collected \\1\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Schedule of Fees for Consular Services\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n                                                                      * * * * * * *\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      Visa Services\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n33.

Therefore, in accordance with section 6 \nof Executive Order 13132, it is determined that this rule does not have \nsufficient federalism implications to require consultations or warrant \nthe preparation of a federalism summary impact statement. The \nregulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding \nintergovernmental consultation on federal programs and activities do \nnot apply to this regulation.\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not preempt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to \nthis rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35.\n\nExecutive Order 14192--Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation\n\n    This rule is not an Executive Order 14192 regulatory action because \nit is being issued with respect to an immigration-related function of \nthe United States. The rule's primary direct purpose is to implement or \ninterpret the immigration laws of the United States (as described in \nINA sec. 101(a)(17), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17)) or any other function \nperformed by the U.S. Federal Government with respect to aliens.\n\nList of Subjects\n\n22 CFR Part 22\n\n    Fees; Foreign service: Immigration; Passports and visas.\n\n 22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure; Aliens; Fees; Foreign \nofficials; Immigration; Passports and visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, the State \nDepartment amends 22 CFR parts 22 42 as follows:\n\nPART 22--SCHEDULE OF FEES FOR CONSULAR SERVICES--DEPARTMENT OF \nSTATE AND FOREIGN SERVICE\n\n0\n1.

    "supplementary_information": "I. Summary\n\n    This TFR establishes a visa bond pilot program (``Pilot Program'') \nunder section 221(g)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as \namended (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1201(g)(3), which authorizes consular officers \nto require the posting of a Maintenance of Status and Departure Bond \n(``visa bond'') by an alien applying for, and otherwise eligible to \nreceive, a business visitor/tourist (B-1/B-2) visa \\1\\ ``to insure that \nat the expiration of the time for which such alien has been admitted . \n. . or upon failure to maintain the status under which [the alien] was \nadmitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under section \n1258 of this title [(INA section 248)], such alien will depart from the \nUnited States.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ For purposes of this rulemaking, ``B1/B2 visa'' refers to a \nbusiness visitor (B-1) visa, tourist (B-2) visa, or combined \nbusiness visitor/tourist (B-1/B-2) visa.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Historically, Department guidance generally discouraged consular \nofficers from exercising their authority to require visa bonds under \nINA section 221(g)(3), as reflected in guidance published in Volume 9 \nof the Foreign Affairs Manual (``9 FAM''), section 403.9-8(A) Bonds \nShould Rarely Be Used,\\2\\ which states, ``[t]he mechanics of posting, \nprocessing and discharging a bond are cumbersome,'' and notes possible \nmisperception of a bond requirement by the public. This view of a bond \nrequirement is not supported by any recent examples or evidence, as \nvisa bonds have not generally been required in any recent period, \nnotwithstanding a 2020 pilot program that did not provide any \nsubstantive data. The Immigration and Naturalization Service Data \nManagement Improvement Act of 2000 mandated the implementation of an \nintegrated entry and exit data system with annual reports to Congress \nincluding among other information, ``the number of aliens who arrived \npursuant to a nonimmigrant visa . . . for whom no matching departure \ndata have been obtained through the system or through other means as of \nthe end of the alien's authorized period of stay, with an accounting by \nthe alien's country of nationality and date of arrival in the United \nStates.'' A review of these reports going back over a decade \ndemonstrates that hundreds of thousands of nonimmigrant visitors fail \nto timely depart in accord with the terms of their visitor visa.\\3\\ The \nPilot Program will enable the Department to assess the operational \nfeasibility of posting, processing, and discharging visa bonds, in \ncoordination with the Department of the Treasury (``Treasury'') and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (``DHS''), and to inform any future \ndecision concerning the possible use of visa bonds to ensure \nnonimmigrants using these visa categories comply with the terms and \nconditions of their visas and timely depart the United States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ <a href=\"https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM040309.html\">https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM040309.html</a>.\n    \\3\\ See Section 2(a) of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService Data Management Improvement Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-215, \n114 Stat. 337, June 15, 2000) deriving from H.R. 4489 introduced May \n18, 2000. As explained in the Congressional Record for May 25, 2000, \nsection 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), mandated an automated entry-\nexit control system with collection of data related to individuals \nwho overstayed their authorized stay. The legislative effort from \n2000 provided then INS with additional time to carry out the \nmandated entry-exit data collection in order to carry out the \npurpose of section 110 of the IIRIRA, which was to track individuals \nwho overstay their allowable stay in the United States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Department published a temporary final rule in 2020 initiating \na six-month visa bond pilot program, aimed at assessing the operational \nfeasibility of a visa bond program, 85 FR 74875 (Nov. 24, 2020). \nHowever, in light of the worldwide reduction in global travel as a \nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department did not implement the \npilot and consequently it did not provide any data on the feasibility \nfor full implementation.\n    This Pilot Program responds to Executive Order 14159, ``Protecting \nThe American People Against Invasion,'' which directs the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, in coordination with the Secretaries of State and \nHomeland Security, to ``establish a system to facilitate the \nadministration of all bonds'' under the provisions of the INA.\\4\\ Under \nthe Pilot Program, as discussed further below, visa bonds may be \nrequired from certain applicants for B-1/B-2 visas who are nationals of \ncountries identified by the Department of State as having high visa \noverstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed \ndeficient or, Citizenship by Investment (``CBI''), if the alien \nobtained citizenship with no residency requirement. The Department will \nannounce the covered countries via Travel.State.Gov no fewer than 15 \ndays before the Pilot Program takes effect, and this list may be \namended throughout the pilot, with 15 days from announcement to \nenactment.\\5\\ In announcing the covered countries, the Department will \nalso provide a brief explanation of the basis for requiring bonds \nconsistent with this rule. The face value of visa bonds will be \ndeposited in the appropriate account using the Treasury-hosted <a href=\"https://www.Pay.Gov\">https://www.Pay.Gov</a> website via Form I-352, Immigration Bond.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ 90 FR 8443 (Jan. 2029, 2025).\n    \\5\\ Aliens traveling under the Visa Waiver Program fall outside \nthe scope of the Pilot Program, as those travelers do not apply for \nvisas.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    DHS regulations at 8 CFR 103.6 provide for the posting, processing, \nand cancellation of such visa bonds. However, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity delegated the authority to the employees of the Department of \nState, as designated by the Secretary of State, to perform duties \nrelated to the acceptance and processing of maintenance of status and \nvisa bonds.\\6\\ The Secretary of State consents to Department of State \nemployees performing duties related to the acceptance and processing of \nvisa bonds as described in this TFR. The Department will accept and \napprove the I-352. Under the process for this Pilot Program, consular \nofficers will require the visa bond be posted via <a href=\"https://www.Pay.Gov\">https://www.Pay.Gov</a> \nas a condition of visa issuance for certain visa applicants. After \nreceiving the visa bond monies,\n\n[[Page 37379]]\n\nthe Treasury will place the visa bond monies in a DHS account, akin to \nan escrow account, held by Treasury subject to directions from DHS and/\nor the Department related to breach or cancellation of the visa bond as \ndescribed in this TFR.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(6); 8 CFR 2.1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII. Purpose of This Rule\n\n    The Department is publishing this TFR to establish the Pilot \nProgram, including: (1) the criteria for identifying visa applicants \nwho will be required to post visa bonds; (2) three levels for the \namount of the bond, with the level to be selected by the consular \nofficer based on an alien's individual circumstances; (3) how covered \ncountries will be announced; and (4) the duration of the Pilot Program. \nThe Pilot Program will help the Department assess the operational \nfeasibility of posting, processing, and discharging visa bonds, in \ncoordination with Treasury and DHS, for the purpose of ensuring the \nlegally required departure of an alien from the United States as \ndescribed in section 221(g)(3) of the INA. This Pilot Program will \ninform any future decision concerning the possible use of visa bonds to \naddress the national security and foreign policy priorities articulated \nin Executive Order 14159. The Pilot Program is further designed to \nserve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all \nappropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all \ncitizens in matters of identity verification and public safety, to \ncreate safeguards in CBI programs that provide citizenship without any \nresidency in the country, and to encourage specified countries with \nvisa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United \nStates after making temporary visits.\n    Executive Order 14159 directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, to ``establish a system to facilitate the administration of \nall bonds that the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity may lawfully require to administer the provisions of the \nINA.'' \\7\\ The Department intends to use the results of the Pilot \nProgram to assess the operational feasibility of posting, processing, \nand discharging visa bonds and to assess the burden such a program \nplaces on government agencies, which will inform any future decision \nconcerning the possible use of visa bonds to address visa overstay \nrates and other security concerns, relative to operational \nconsiderations. The operational feasibility of posting, processing, and \ndischarging visa bonds focuses on assessing the burdens such a program \nplaces on government agencies and identifying challenges that might \narise from the interagency process for implementing visa bonds. While \nthis Pilot Program is primarily designed to study the operational \nfeasibility of implementing visa bonds, data collected during the Pilot \nmay also be used to determine the effectiveness of visa bonds at \nreducing overstays, evaluate concerns about insufficient identity \nverification, and the extent to which visa bonds may deter otherwise \nlegitimate B-1 and B-2 visa applicants from traveling to the United \nStates.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 90 FR at 8446.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII. Background\n\nA. Foreign Policy Justification\n\n    Executive Order 14159 directs Treasury, in coordination with DHS \nand the Department, to take all appropriate action to implement a visa \nbond program. By its design and intention, the Pilot Program is a tool \nof diplomacy, intended to encourage foreign governments to take \nimmediate action to reduce the overstay rates of their nationals when \ntraveling to the United States for temporary visits, and to encourage \ncountries to improve screening and vetting and the security of travel \nand civil documents, including in the granting of citizenship. As such, \nthe rule properly is described as a key pillar of the Trump \nAdministration's foreign policy to protect the United States from the \nclear national security threat posed by visa overstays and deficient \nscreening and vetting.\n    The Secretary of State determined in Public Notice 12682 \\8\\ that \nsecuring America's borders and protecting its citizens from external \nthreats is the first and highest priority of the foreign affairs \nfunction of the United States.\\9\\ This effort requires the United \nStates to marshal all available resources and authorities in support of \nsecuring the borders of the United States, including removing \nindividual aliens who remain in the United States unlawfully. Executive \nOrder 14159 states that ``[m]any of these aliens unlawfully present in \nthe United States present significant threats to national security and \npublic safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent \nAmericans. Others are engaged in hostile activities, including \nespionage, economic espionage, and preparations for terror-related \nactivities. Many have abused the generosity of the American people, and \ntheir presence in the United States has cost taxpayers billions of \ndollars at the Federal, State, and Local levels.'' This TFR addresses \nthe Trump Administration's call to protect the American people by \nfaithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ See Determination: Foreign Affairs Function of the United \nStates, 90 FR 12200 (Mar. 14, 2025).\n    \\9\\ See, e.g., Executive Orders 14150, 14157, 14160, 14161, \n14165.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    DHS produces annual reports containing nonimmigrant overstay data. \nIn the DHS FY 2023 Overstay Report, DHS data indicated there were over \n500,000 ``Suspected In-Country Overstays \\10\\ (i.e., aliens who \nremained in the country past the end of their authorized stay and had \nyet to depart the country) among nonimmigrants admitted through air or \nsea ports of entry.\\11\\ The Department's review of DHS nonimmigrant \nreports, which have been regularly published since 2015, indicates that \nthe average number of aggregated annual overstays is typically in the \nhundreds of thousands, with several countries having significant \npercentages or numbers of individual aliens who are believed to have \noverstayed their nonimmigrant visas.\\12\\ Furthermore, the total number \nof annual overstays among foreign nationals admitted to the United \nStates at an air or sea port of entry as nonimmigrant visitors for \nbusiness or pleasure on a B-1 or B-2 visa, excluding travelers from \nMexico, Canada, and Visa Waiver Program (VWP) participating \ncountries,\\13\\ has fluctuated in recent years, based on statistics \npublished by DHS. For fiscal years beginning 2015, DHS has published an \n``Overstay Report'' with a broad range of statistics relating to \n``overstays,'' which DHS defines, for purposes of these reports, as ``a \nnonimmigrant who was lawfully admitted to the United States for an\n\n[[Page 37380]]\n\nauthorized period but stayed in the United States beyond [his or her] \nauthorized admission period.'' \\14\\ As explained in the report, if a \nnonimmigrant timely applies for an extension of the authorized period \nof admission or applies to change or adjust status, the authorized \nperiod of admission may be extended, thereby avoiding being counted as \noverstay. The reports for fiscal years 2015 through 2023 include \nstatistics on foreign nationals who entered the United States at an \nairport or sea port of entry on a B-1 or B-2 visa, excluding travelers \nfrom Mexico, Canada, and VWP participating countries. For fiscal year \n2019, DHS reported a total of 320,086 overstays among this category of \nnonimmigrant visitors, including ``out-of-country'' overstays (i.e., \nthose who departed some time before the end of FY 2019) and in-country \noverstays (i.e., those who remained in the United States at the end of \nFY 2019).\\15\\ The number of such overstays fluctuated during and after \nthe COVID pandemic, rising from 352,748 for FY 2020,\\16\\ to 504,636 for \nFY 2022,\\17\\ finally back to 314,111 for FY 2023.\\18\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See DHS, Fiscal Year 2023 Entry/Exit Overstay Report, \n<a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/publication/entryexit-overstay-report\">https://www.dhs.gov/publication/entryexit-overstay-report</a>.\n    \\11\\ ``Fiscal Year 2023 Entry/Exit Overstay Report'' prepared by \nDHS and submitted to Congress pursuant to Section 2(a) of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement \nAct of 2000 (Pub.

In the Report, DHS further explained that \nby the end of December 2023, the number of Suspected In-Country \nOverstays for FY 2023 decreased to 510,363, due to departures and \nadjustments of status by aliens in that population. The report \nexplains that overstay statistics reported do not take into account \ndiplomats and other representatives, crewmembers, aliens in transit, \nand section 1367 special-protected classes, because they have \n``unspecified authorized periods of stay and legal protections.'' \nDHS FY 2023 Overstay Report at Section III(C).\n    \\12\\ See historical listing of DHS Entry/Exit Overstay Reports \nfrom 2015 to 2023.

Legal Framework Underlying the Pilot Program\n\n    As detailed below, the INA grants, and Department regulations \nimplement, consular officer authority to require bonds in appropriate \ncircumstances. Although, historically, as a matter of policy, \nDepartment guidance has discouraged consular officers from exercising \ntheir authority to require bonds,\\20\\ a fresh review of DHS entry-exit \ndata has been compiled since 2015, and pursuant to authorities set \nforth in 1996 by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act, amended by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService Data Management Improvement Act of 2000, and viewed in \nconjunction with E.O. 14159 and Public Notice 12682, the Department is \nrevisiting this historical guidance by first determining the \nfeasibility of a different approach to addressing the significant \nforeign policy and national security threats presented by the hundreds \nof thousands of annual nonimmigrant visitor overstays.\\21\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See 9 FAM 403.9-8(A) Bonds Should Rarely Be Used.\n    \\21\\ See 9 FAM 403.9-8(A) Bonds Should Rarely Be Used.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. INA Provisions\n    Section 221(g)(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(g)(3), authorizes \nconsular officers to require the posting of a bond by an alien applying \nfor, and otherwise eligible to receive, a business/tourist (B-1/B-2) \nvisa ``to insure that at the expiration of the time for which such \nalien has been admitted . . . or upon failure to maintain the status \nunder which [the alien] was admitted, or to maintain any status \nsubsequently acquired under section 1258 of this title [(INA sec. \n248)], such alien will depart from the United States.'' INA sec. \n221(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1201(g)(3), implicitly recognizes that there is no \nguarantee that an alien will depart in a timely fashion, even when an \napplicant is found otherwise eligible for the visa. Consequently, the \nsame INA section contemplates that it may be appropriate to require a \nbond when an applicant is otherwise eligible for a visa.\n2. Applicable Regulations\n    Regulations regarding visa bonds include 22 CFR 41.11(b)(2), which \nprovides that, ``[i]n a borderline case in which an alien appears to be \notherwise entitled to receive a visa under INA 101(a)(15)(B) or (F) but \nthe consular officer concludes that the maintenance of the alien's \nstatus or the departure of the alien from the United States as required \nis not fully assured, a visa may nevertheless be issued upon the \nposting of a bond with the Secretary of Homeland Security under terms \nand conditions prescribed by the consular officer.'' Additionally, 22 \nCFR 41.31(a)(1) references consular officer authority to require bonds \nfrom applicants for visas for temporary visits for business or pleasure \n(B-1/B-2) whose maintenance of status or departure ``does not seem \nfully assured.'' 8 CFR 221.1 provides, ``The district director having \njurisdiction over the intended place of residence of an alien may \naccept a bond on behalf of an alien defined in section 101(a)(15)(B) or \n(F) of the Act prior to the issuance of a visa to the alien or upon \nreceipt of a request directly from a U.S. consular officer or upon \npresentation by an interested person of a notification from the \nconsular officer requiring such a bond; such a bond also may be \naccepted by the district director with jurisdiction over the port of \nentry or pre-inspection station where inspection of the alien takes \nplace.'' 8 CFR 221.1 also outlines some procedural aspects of bond \nprocessing and refers to 8 CFR 103.6 for more procedural rules relating \nto bonds. Lastly, 8 CFR 103.6 outlines the procedures relating to bond \nriders, acceptable sureties, cancellation, or breaching of bonds in \ndetail. These regulations reinforce the broad scope of the statutory \nauthority of the Department and consular officers to require bonds to \nhelp ensure the timely departure from the United States of any visitor \non a B-1/B-2 visa, when the alien is otherwise eligible for a visa, \nbecause an alien's departure after entering the United States can never \nbe fully assured at the time of visa issuance or admission to this \ncountry.\n3. Foreign Affairs Manual\n    Despite the regulatory foundation for consular officers to issue \nvisa bonds, historically, as a matter of policy, the Department has \ndiscouraged consular officers from exercising their authority to \nrequire bonds, as reflected in volume 9 of the Foreign Affairs Manual \nat section 403.9-8(A), which provides, ``[a]lthough 22 CFR 41.11(b)(2) \npermits consular officers, in certain cases, to require a maintenance \nof status and departure bond, it is Department policy that such bonds \nwill rarely, if ever, be used.'' The FAM section indicates that this \npolicy relies, in part, on an assessment that ``[t]he mechanics of \nposting, processing and discharging a bond are cumbersome.'' The Pilot \nProgram will help the Department assess the continued reliance upon the\n\n[[Page 37381]]\n\nuntested historical assessment that imposing visa bonds to achieve the \nforeign policy and national security goals of the United States remains \ntoo cumbersome to be practical. The pilot program will allow the \nDepartment to truly determine the operational feasibility of posting, \nprocessing, and discharging visa bonds, in coordination with Treasury \nand DHS, and inform future decisions concerning the use of visa bonds \nas a diplomatic tool to address overstays and insufficient identity \nverification, including for citizens of CBI countries who obtained \ncitizenship with no residency requirement. The Pilot Program will \nconstitute an exception to that general guidance with respect to the \ncategories of aliens covered by the Pilot Program, during the 12-month \nduration of the Pilot Program.\n\nIV. Parameters of the Pilot Program\n\n    The Pilot Program will last 12 months, beginning on the effective \ndate of this TFR. The program will be limited to aliens who are: \napplying for B-1/B-2 nonimmigrant visas and are nationals of countries \nthat the Department has identified: (1) as having high visa overstay \nrates; (2) where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient; \nor (3) as offering CBI, if the alien obtained citizenship with no \nresidency requirement. The Department has selected these criteria as \nthe bases for requiring a bond because they are generally indicators \nthat an applicant may pose a higher potential to overstay his or her \nadmitted stay in the United States or otherwise fail to maintain the \nstatus in which he or she was admitted, or to maintain any nonimmigrant \nstatus subsequently acquired. The Department has reached this \nconclusion for the following reasons. First, the Department finds that \na country's high overstay rate is an indicator that a national of that \ncountry is at a higher risk of overstaying than nationals of countries \nwith lower overstay rates. Second, the Department finds that nationals \nof countries where vetting and screening are deficient are nationals \nfor whom there are concerns about overstay risks because the Department \nhas difficulty obtaining full background and criminal history \ninformation. Third, nationals of a country with CBI who obtained \ncitizenship with no residency requirement may have insufficient \npersonal history within or connections to their country of nationality \nfor sufficient screening and vetting checks to be conducted. Covered \nvisa applicants will be required to post a bond of up to $15,000 as a \ncondition of visa issuance, with the exact amount of the bond based \nupon the applicant's circumstances as determined by the consular \nofficer but in an amount of no less than $5,000, unless the bond \nrequirement is waived. Compliance with the bond will require arrival \ninto and departure from the United States by air from one of the \nairports pre-selected for use during this pilot program, based on their \ncapacity to automatically confirm that the alien has departed the \nUnited States in accordance with the bond's conditions. The selected \nairports will be announced on <a href=\"http://www.travel.state.gov\">www.travel.state.gov</a> 15 days ahead of \nbonds being implemented and may be modified on a rolling basis.\n\nA. Overstay Rates and Deficient Screening and Vetting\n\n    For purposes of the Pilot Program, country overstay rates will be \ndetermined based on the DHS FY 2023 Overstay Report, which is the most \nrecent edition of this report and was published on August 5, 2024.\\22\\ \nThe countries subject to the pilot program will be determined based on \nDHS published data on overstays by nationals of the country admitted to \nthe United States as a temporary visitor for business or pleasure (B-1/\nB-2 nonimmigrant status) via air and seaports of entry. The data set \nexcluded Canada, Mexico, and countries participating in the VWP.\\23\\ \nRegarding countries that have deficient screening and vetting \ninformation, Executive Order 14161 directs the Secretary of State to \nidentify ``countries throughout the world for which vetting and \nscreening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full \nsuspension on the admission of nationals.'' Following that review, on \nJune 4, 2025, President Trump issued Proclamation 10949, titled \n``Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals To Protect the United \nStates From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public \nSafety Threats,'' in which the President determined to either fully or \npartially restrict and limit the entry of nationals from specific \ncountries.\\24\\ Finally, regarding nationals of countries with CBI who \nobtained citizenship without any residence requirement, these \napplicants are sometimes able to undergo a name change to conceal past \ncriminal or other illicit ties, and are not tied to the host country`s \nscreening and vetting apparatus. Furthermore, Executive Order 14161 \ndirected the Secretary to ``evaluate all visa programs to ensure that \nthey are not used by foreign nation-states or other hostile actors to \nharm the security, economic, political, cultural, or other national \ninterests of the United States.'' The countries covered by the Pilot \nProgram will be announced via <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov\">travel.state.gov</a> 15 days ahead of bonds \nbeing implemented and may be modified on a rolling basis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ Id.

For purposes of the DHS FY 2023 Overstay Report \nand this Pilot Program, a ``visa overstay'' is an alien who was \nlawfully admitted to the United States and remains in the United States \nbeyond the period of admission authorized by DHS. The initial \nauthorized admission period is a fixed period determined by DHS at the \ntime a B-1/B-2 visa holder applies for admission to the United States, \nbut in some circumstances, an admission period may be extended by U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) upon adjudication of an \napplication for an extension of stay or change of nonimmigrant status.\n    Under the terms of the Pilot Program, an alien admitted to the \nUnited States for a temporary period as a nonimmigrant will have his or \nher bond cancelled if the alien (a) complies with all the conditions of \neach specific nonimmigrant status which she or he is accorded while \nclassified in such status, including the condition that the alien \nshould not accept unauthorized employment, and (b) departs from the \nUnited States on or before the date to which he or she is authorized to \nremain in the United States. An alien will also have his or her bond \ncancelled if he or she (a) is granted or has timely and properly filed \nan application for an extension of stay or a change in nonimmigrant \nstatus, (b) complies with all the conditions of each specific \nnonimmigrant status which he or she is accorded while in such status, \nincluding the condition that the alien should not accept unauthorized \nemployment, and (c) departs from the United States on or before the \nextended date to which she or he is authorized to remain in the United \nStates.\n    The bond obligation shall become due and payable if the alien \nbreaches the visa bond by: (a) violating any condition of his or her \nstatus; (b) filing an unexcused untimely application for\n\n[[Page 37382]]\n\nchange of status or extension of his or her lawful admission; (c) \nremaining in the United States after expiration of the period of \nadmission or (d), if the alien timely and properly files an application \nfor change of status or extension of her or his lawful temporary stay, \nthe alien does not depart the United States within 10 days after denial \nof such request.\n\nB. Posting Bonds via Treasury's www.Pay.Gov Interface\n\n    As noted above, the purpose of the Pilot Program is to assess, in \ncoordination with Treasury and DHS, the operational feasibility of: (1) \nposting the bond via Treasury's www.Pay.Gov service; and (2) \nprocessing, and discharging visa bonds, to inform any future decision \nconcerning the possible use of visa bonds to address overstays and \nother identified immigration policy concerns.\n\nC. B-1/B-2 Visa Applicants Only\n\n    To determine the feasibility of the Pilot Program, the Department \nis conducting a pilot to collect data and limiting the pilot to aliens \nwhose authorized period of admission in the United States should be \nconcluded within the designated time period, allowing for data \ncollection at all stages of the process. Although section 221(g)(3), of \nthe INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(g)(3), authorizes consular officers to require \nvisa bonds from applicants for B-1/B-2 visas and F (student) visas, the \nPilot Program is limited to B-1/B-2 visa applicants, because their \nauthorized period of stay after admission to the United States is fixed \nby DHS Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the port of \nentry and typically lasts a matter of months. CBP officers typically \nauthorize a maximum of one year for business visitors pursuant to 8 CFR \n214.2(b)(1), and typically six months for tourists, in accordance with \n8 CFR 214.2(b)(2). In contrast, F-1 nonimmigrant students generally are \nadmitted for the duration of their status as of the time this rule was \npublished, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5), which commonly is multiple \nyears. Because the Pilot Program will last only for a limited duration, \nF-1 nonimmigrant students, who are in most cases likely to be \nauthorized to remain in the United States for multiple years, would be \nunlikely to complete the bond cycle (which ends with cancellation or \nbreach of the bond) during the duration of the Pilot Program. B-1/B-2 \nvisas issued to aliens covered by the Pilot Program will be annotated \nto reflect the visa bond requirement. That annotation may be taken into \naccount by CBP officers which will generally limit the period of \nadmission for any such visa holders to 30 days.\n\nD. Limited Waiver Process\n\n    For the duration of the Pilot Program, there will be no bond waiver \napplication process. Section 41.11(c)(3) of the Department's \nregulations in title 22 CFR grants the Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) \nfor Visa Services discretionary authority to waive the bond \nrequirement, for an alien or a category of aliens, if the DAS assesses \nthat a waiver would not be contrary to the national interest. Because \nall visa applicants will be presumed to want a waiver of the bond \nrequirement, and because the only information that might be provided by \nan applicant that would be relevant to a waiver decision is the \napplicant's purpose of travel and possibly employment, which already is \nrequested from all applicants, there will be no bond waiver application \nprocess. However, consular officers will have the authority to request \nwaivers in very limited circumstances, such as travel for U.S. \nGovernment employees or urgent humanitarian needs, and the DAS for Visa \nServices has the discretionary authority to grant or deny those \nrecommendations.\n\nE. Bond Amounts\n\n    In accordance with the statutory and regulatory framework described \nabove, the Department, through consular officers, has broad authority \nto require a visa applicant to post a bond in such sum and with such \nconditions as would help ensure the alien's timely departure from the \nUnited States. To promote the efficiency of the Pilot Program and avoid \narbitrary and inconsistent bond amounts, the Department is setting \nguidelines for the bond amount. Because INA section 221(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. \n1201(g)(3), indicates consular officers must consider each visa \napplicant's personal circumstances in setting the bond amount, by its \nreference to the consular officer prescribing a bond's sum and \nconditions to be sufficient to insure ``such alien will depart from the \nUnited States'' in a timely manner, the Department is providing \nconsular officers three options for bond amounts: $5,000, $10,000, and \n$15,000. The Department believes these three levels will provide \nconsular officers discretion to require a bond in an amount that is \nsufficient enough to ensure the alien does not overstay, while taking \ninto account the visa applicant's circumstances.\n    Consular officers will be expected to set the bond amount at \n$10,000, unless the officer has reason to believe the visa applicant's \ncircumstances would render the applicant unable to pay that amount (but \nyet remain sufficiently financed to pay all travel expenses through the \nperiod of intended stay in the United States), in which case the bond \nwould be set at $5,000. Alternatively, if the alien's circumstances, \nincluding the nature and extent of the alien's contacts in the United \nStates, would suggest a $10,000 bond would not be sufficient to ensure \nthe alien would timely depart the United States, the officer would \nrequire a $15,000 bond as a condition of visa issuance. In making such \ndeterminations, consular officers will take into account the totality \nof the circumstances, including any information provided by the visa \napplicant on the visa application or in the visa interview regarding \nthe alien's purpose of travel, current employment, income, skills, and \neducation.\n    The three options for bond amounts were set following consultations \nwith Treasury and DHS. In setting the amounts, the Department took into \nconsideration costs associated with removal, including the full \nImmigration Enforcement Lifecycle cost (including mission support \ncosts) ending with removal, as computed by DHS at approximately $17,121 \nper alien.\\25\\ The Department viewed these costs as relevant, because \nan alien who overstays his or her authorized period of stay and who \nmust be placed into removal proceedings requires the U.S. government to \nincur immigration enforcement-related costs that otherwise would not be \nincurred. For the purposes of the Pilot Program, an alien who breaches \na bond would generally forfeit the bond amount, which could be used, in \npart, to reimburse the U.S. government for expenses incurred in the\n\n[[Page 37383]]\n\ncollection of breached bonds and for expenses associated with the \ndetention of illegal aliens, necessitated by the alien overstaying his \nor her authorized period of stay.\\26\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ Immigration Enforcement Lifecycle (IEL) cost represents a \nfully burdened managerial cost accounting for the average cost \nburden to perform each aspect of the lifecycle, yielding a total IEL \ncost per overstaying alien in the year of budget execution. The cost \nis developed and published by the ICE Office of the CFO (CFO)/Office \nof Budget Program and Performance (OBPP)/Performance Analysis & \nEvaluation (PA&E) at the end of each fiscal year. In Fiscal Year \n(FY) 2024, the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Policy \nPlanning and Administration (PPA) was given an appropriation of \n$5.082 billion across its five (5) sub-PPAs to enforce immigration \nlaw and remove illegal aliens from the United States. The lifecycle \ncalculation includes the baseline direct cost expenditures of the \nERO PPA, which are the personnel and general expenditures required \nfor operational enforcement on a daily basis. To this amount is \nadded the indirect management and administrative (M&A) costs of ICE \npersonnel who assist the ERO Program in accomplishing its mission. \nThis includes support from such components as acquisition (OAQ), \ninformation technology (OCIO), asset management (OAFM), human \nresources (OHC), budget (CFO/OBPP), and legal advisory (OPLA). For \nFY 2024, the total IEL cost is approximately $17,121 per illegal \nalien.\n    \\26\\ 8 U.S.C. 1356(r)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nF. Duration of Pilot Program\n\n    The Department will conduct the Pilot Program for 12 months, \nbeginning on August 20, 2025. The Department determined, in \nconsultation with Treasury and DHS, that 12 months is an adequate \nperiod to ensure that multiple visa applicants will have completed the \nfull bond cycle, from the visa interview, through travel to the United \nStates, to a final determination of bond cancellation or breach. \nExperience with each of the steps of the bond cycle is necessary to \nassess the operational feasibility of posting, processing and \ndischarging a visa bond, in coordination with Treasury and DHS. \nFollowing the conclusion of the Pilot Program, consular officers no \nlonger will require the posting of bonds based on the guidance set out \nin this TFR; however, any visa bonds posted as part of the Pilot \nProgram will remain in effect until either breached or cancelled, in \naccordance with terms and conditions set out on Form I-352, Immigration \nBond, even after the Pilot Program period has ended.\n\nV. Visa Bond Procedures Under the Pilot Program\n\nA. Applying for a Visa\n\n    All applicants from covered countries as listed on Travel.State.Gov \nwill apply for nonimmigrant visas by following the standard procedures \nincluding scheduling an appointment at the consular section at a U.S. \nembassy or consulate and paying the associated Machine-Readable Visa \nfees.\n\nB. Setting the Bond\n\n    During the course of the visa interview, a consular officer will \ndetermine if an applicant is otherwise eligible for a visa, and if the \napplicant falls within the scope of the Pilot Program. If the applicant \nfalls within the scope of the Pilot Program, the consular officer will \ninform the applicant of the bond requirement and the amount of the \nrequired bond, whether $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000. The consular \nofficer will advise the applicant that he or she must post a bond and \nthe consular officer will deny the visa under INA section 221(g), 8 \nU.S.C. 1201(g), to provide further information about posting the bond \nthrough the www.Pay.Gov interface. That denial may be overcome if a \nbond in the required amount is duly posted within 30 days of the \ninterview by the visa applicant or on the visa applicant's behalf by a \nsingle payer. The officer will provide to the applicant: (1) a notice \nexplaining the bond requirement and procedures for posting a cash bond \nvia www.Pay.Gov and (2) the link to the www.Pay.Gov site for posting \nthe bond. DHS regulations at 8 CFR 103.6 currently provide for the \nposting, processing, and cancellation of such visa bonds. Due to the \nshort duration of the visas being issued, should the visa applicant \npost the bond more than 30 days after the interview, the consular \nofficer may conduct a further interview to reconfirm the applicant's \npurpose of travel.\n\nC. Paying the Bond\n\n    The Department will email the applicant, using the contact \ninformation provided by the applicant, providing him or her a link to \nsubmit a Form I-352 associated with his or her application and the \nrequired bond amount payable through www.Pay.Gov. Submission of the \nForm I-352 includes submission of the required bond amount. All terms \nand conditions set out on Form I-352 applicable to maintenance of \nstatus and departure bonds shall apply. The obligor on the bond, \nwhether a person who posts a cash bond on behalf of the visa applicant \nor the visa applicant, will be informed if the visa applicant fails to \ncomply with the terms and conditions of the bond and, consequently, \nthat the bond has been breached. The procedures for determining and \nenforcing a breach are set out on Form I-352 and in DHS regulations, \nincluding 8 CFR 103.6. However, as stated above, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security delegated the authority to the employees of the \nDepartment of State, as designated by the Secretary of State, to \nperform duties related to the acceptance and processing of maintenance \nof status and visa bonds.\\27\\ State will receive confirmation from \nTreasury that the bond has been posted, at which point State will \napprove the Form I-352 and return an electronic copy to the applicant.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ See 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(6); 8 CFR 2.1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nD. Issuing the Visa\n\n    The consular section where the visa applicant applied will rely on \ncontact information provided by the applicant to contact the applicant \nregarding the final process to issue the visa. If, upon further review, \nthe consular officer determines the applicant is not eligible for the \nrequested visa, the consular officer will deny the visa, and the bond \nwill be cancelled. If the required bond is posted, and the consular \nofficer subsequently determines the applicant remains otherwise \neligible for a visa, the officer will issue the visa, valid for a \nsingle entry within three months of the date of visa issuance, with an \nannotation indicating the posting of a visa bond.\n    <bullet> This limited visa validity period is necessary to increase \nthe likelihood that travel, notwithstanding the terms of the bond, is \ncompleted within a time frame conducive to gathering data from the \nPilot Program.\n    <bullet> During the Pilot Program, as a condition of the bond, \nthese visa holders may only enter and depart the United States through \npre-selected ports of entry. These ports of entry will be announced via \n<a href=\"http://travel.state.gov\">travel.state.gov</a>.\n    <bullet> The visa annotation will alert CBP officers at these ports \nof entry that the applicant has posted a visa bond under the Pilot \nProgram.\n    <bullet> CBP officers at the port of entry will limit the period of \nadmission to 30 days.\n\nE. Cancellation of the Bond--Return\n\n    Pursuant to 8 CFR 103.6(c)(3), the bond should be canceled when \nthere has been ``substantial performance of all conditions imposed by \nthe terms of the bond.'' \\28\\ Bond proceeds will be returned for any \nvisa holder who complies with the terms and conditions of the bond, \nbased on information provided by DHS through the Arrival and Departure \nInformation System (ADIS) in the following circumstances:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ Conditions of the bond as set forth in paragraph G(4) of \nForm I-352.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> Following the timely departure from the United States of a \nvisa holder for whom a bond was posted, as captured in the visa \nholder's departure from the United States through a designated air port \nof entry.\n    <bullet> Upon expiration of the visa, if the visa holder did not \ntravel to the United States, as captured by ADIS.\n    <bullet> Following CBP deeming the visa holder inadmissible and \ncancelling the visa by CBP at the port of entry, as captured by ADIS.\n    The applicant on any canceled bond will be entitled to a full \nrefund. There will be no accrued interest on visa bonds that are issued \nand canceled as part of this pilot program. The Department also will \nprovide the applicant with a Notice--Immigration Bond Cancelled (Form \nI-391), which confirms compliance with the conditions of the bond.\n\n[[Page 37384]]\n\nF. Cancellation of the Bond--Manual Request\n\n    A visa holder may pursue cancellation of the bond by requesting an \nappointment with consular officials outside the United States within 30 \ndays of his or her departure from the United States, or if a visa \nholder wishes to cancel the bond before the visa expires and without \ntraveling. A consular officer will only approve this appointment if the \nconsular officer confirms that the visa holder's departure was not \nregistered in ADIS. A visa holder may confirm his or her identity by \npresenting a passport and responding to questions by the consular \nofficer to confirm identity. He or she should also provide evidence \ndemonstrating that he or she departed the United States on or before \nthe expiration of their authorized period of stay. There are no \nparticular documents required to demonstrate timely departure from the \nUnited States. Travelers may present to the consular officer a variety \nof information, including but not limited to:\n    <bullet> Original boarding passes used to depart the United States;\n    <bullet> Photocopies of entry or departure stamps in a passport \nindicating entry to another country after departure from the United \nStates (the traveler should copy all passport pages that are not \ncompletely blank, and include the biographical page containing his or \nher photograph); and\n    <bullet> Photocopies of other supporting evidence, such as:\n    <bullet> Dated pay slips or vouchers from an employer to indicate \nwork in another country after departure from the United States,\n    <bullet> Dated bank records showing transactions to indicate \npresence in another country after departure from the United States,\n    <bullet> School records showing attendance at a school outside the \nUnited States after departure from the United States, and\n    <bullet> Dated credit card receipts showing the traveler's name, \nwith the credit card number deleted, for purchases made after leaving \nthe United States.\n    The visa holder may also be required to demonstrate that he or she \nmaintained the conditions of his or her status while admitted to the \nUnited States. A consular officer then will assess the information \nreceived to make a preliminary determination regarding whether the \napplicant has complied with the terms of the bond or breach has \noccurred.\n\nE. Bond Breach\n\n    If a visa holder fails to comply with the terms and conditions set \nforth in Form I-352, the bond will be considered breached, and the bond \ndeposit will be forfeited. If the Department makes a preliminary \nfinding that a visa holder has not complied with the terms and \nconditions of the bond, the Department will then forward the case to \nDHS, which is responsible for making the final determination pursuant \nto 8 CFR 103.6(c)(3). A visa bond will be forfeited when there has been \na substantial violation of the terms and conditions set forth in \nparagraph G(4) of Form I-352.\n    At the conclusion of the Pilot Program, consular officers will no \nlonger require the posting of bonds based on this TFR; however, any \nbonds posted under the Pilot Program will remain in effect until either \nbreached or cancelled in accordance with their terms and conditions of \nissuance.\nAppeal of a Bond Breach Determination\n    The rights relating to the appeal of a DHS determination of a bond \nbreach, including which rights would accrue after DHS makes a bond \nbreach determination, are detailed in the instructions on Form I-352 \nand Form I-290B.\nBenefits and Costs\n    The benefit of this Pilot Program will be a practical assessment of \nthe operational feasibility of posting, processing, and discharging \nvisa bonds and to assess the burden such a program places on government \nagencies, which will inform any future decision concerning the possible \nuse of visa bonds to address visa overstay rates and other immigration \npolicy goals, relative to operational considerations. If the visa bond \nprogram is determined to be operationally feasible, it would serve as a \ncritical diplomatic tool to compel other countries to address overstays \nby their nationals and to address deficiencies in their identity \nverification standards and practices.\n    Until the Pilot Program countries are selected, the Department is \nunable to estimate the number of visa applicants that will fall within \nthe scope of the Pilot Program. However, the Department expects the \nparameters of, and the countries included in, the Pilot Program to be \nlimited due to the number of aliens expected to be found otherwise \nqualified for visas, and uncertainty as to the number of aliens who \nwill choose to post a visa bond. For these reasons, the Department \nassumes visa bonds will be required for 2,000 visa applicants during \nthe 12-month Pilot Program. If the average bond is $10,000 (from \noptions of $5,000, $10,000, and $15,000), the initial cost to aliens of \nbonds for 2,000 visa applicants will be $20,000,000. However, assuming \nall nonimmigrants for whom bonds are posted comply with the terms and \nconditions of the bond, the actual bond amount is a temporary \nexpenditure that will be fully refunded if cash bonds are posted.\n    The estimated amount of time needed for an average respondent to \ncomplete Form I-352 is thirty minutes (.50 hours) per response. The \nestimated additional time burden associated with this TFR, which will \ninclude arranging for the posting of a bond and returning to a consular \nsection following their departure from the United States to confirm \ntheir compliance with the terms and conditions of the bond, is \nestimated to be two hours.\\29\\ The 2024 Bureau of Labor Statistics \nestimate for the median U.S. hourly wage for all occupations is \n$23.80,\\30\\ thus the Department estimates that this will cost each \nalien $47.60.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ If the alien is determined to be eligible for the visa, the \nalien will be required to pay the bond via <a href=\"http://www.pay.gov\">www.pay.gov</a> and return to \nthe Consular Section to complete processing and issuance. The \nDepartment estimates that for most aliens this will take no more \nthan two hours.\n    \\30\\ <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/oes/#/industry/000000\">https://data.bls.gov/oes/#/industry/000000</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The total cost to the government associated with this Pilot Program \nwill be determined by the number of visa applicants that will fall \nwithin the scope of the Pilot Program. That amount will include \nprinting costs, the collection and processing burden for each Form I-\n352, and additional processing by consular officers. The cost of \nprinting two forms per response is $0.75. The collection and processing \nof each Form I-352 takes an average of 6 hours and will be conducted by \na government employee with an average hourly wage plus overhead, \nestimated to be $28.02. The estimated additional time a consular \nofficer with an average hourly wage of $135 will expend for each case \nsubject to a bond is 30 minutes. If a traveler breaches a bond posted \npursuant to this TFR, DHS will incur some cost in collecting on the \nbond. Because DHS has no reliable basis for estimating the number of \ntravelers or the percentage of travelers posting bonds who will breach \nthe terms and conditions of the bond, DOS is unable to estimate the \ncost associated with enforcing bond breaches.\n\nVI. Regulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA)\n\n    The Secretary of State has determined that all policy related to \nvisa operations and issuance, among other matters, constitutes a \nforeign affairs function of the United States under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (5 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page 37385]]\n\n553(a)(1)).\\31\\ The subject matter of this TFR involves visa policy, \nwhich is a foreign affairs function of the United States, directly \nimplicating relationships between the United States and the specific \ncountries whose nationals may be subject to the Pilot Program. The \nPilot Program will, among other things, allow the Department to study \nthe feasibility of using nonimmigrant visa bonds as a potential \ndiplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take immediate \naction to ensure that their nationals timely depart the United States \nafter making temporary visits. Therefore, this TFR clearly and directly \nimpacts the foreign affairs functions of the United States and \n``implicat[es] matters of diplomacy directly.'' City of N.Y. v. \nPermanent Mission of India to the U.N., 618 F.3d 172, 202 (2d Cir. \n2010).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ See Determination: Foreign Affairs Function of the United \nStates, 90 FR 12200 (Mar. 14, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Consistent with the Secretary's determination regarding rules that \ninvolve a foreign affairs function, the Pilot Program is a tool of \ndiplomacy to influence actions by foreign governments. By requiring \nvisa bonds for visa applicants from the listed countries with high \noverstay rates for B-1/B-2 visa holders, inadequate documentation or \nscreening and vetting, and CBI without residency, the Pilot Program \naims to encourage those countries to cooperate with the United States \nin ensuring timely departure of their citizens/nationals from the \nUnited States and to signal to other countries that the United States \ntakes overstays seriously. The Department's focus on these countries \nwill demonstrate the United States' intolerance of visa overstays and \nencourage the foreign governments to cooperate in addressing overstays \nby their nationals. Accordingly, this TFR is properly viewed as one \nthat ``clearly and directly involve[s] activities or actions \ncharacteristic to the conduct of international relations.'' Capital \nArea Immigrants' Rights Coal. v. Trump, 471 F. Supp. 3d 25, 53 (D.D.C. \n2020).\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    This TFR would not regulate ``small entities'' as that term is \ndefined in 5 U.S.C. 601(6) and as such would not have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This TFR \nonly proposes to regulate individual visa applicants. The Department \naffirms that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Act of 1995\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1532, generally \nrequires agencies to prepare a statement before proposing any rule that \nmay result in an annual expenditure of $100 million or more by State, \nlocal, or tribal governments, or by the private sector. This TFR does \nnot require the Department to prepare a statement because it will not \nresult in any such expenditure, nor will it significantly or directly \naffect small governments, including State, local, or tribal \ngovernments, or the private sector. This TFR involves visas for aliens, \nand does not directly or substantially affect State, local, or tribal \ngovernments, or businesses.\n\nCongressional Review Act of 1996\n\n    The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined \nthat this TFR is not a major rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 804, for \npurposes of congressional review of agency rulemaking. This TFR will \nnot result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; \na major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on \ncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on \nthe ability of companies based in the United States to compete with \nforeign based companies in domestic and import markets.\n\nExecutive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and Executive \nOrder 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), direct agencies to assess \nthe costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. These Executive Orders stress the importance of \nquantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing \nrules, and of promoting flexibility. The Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs has determined that this is a significant regulatory \naction under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132--Federalism\n\n    This Temporary Final Rule will not have substantial direct effects \non the States, on the relationship between the national government and \nthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among \nthe various levels of government. Nor will the Temporary Final Rule \nhave federalism implications warranting the application of Executive \nOrders 12372 and 13132.\n\nExecutive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Order 12988--Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed this TFR in light of sections 3(a) and \n3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, minimize \nlitigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce burden.\n\nExecutive Order 14192--Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation\n\n    This rule is not an Executive Order 14192 regulatory action because \nit is being issued with respect to foreign affairs and immigration \nrelated functions of the United States. The rule's primary direct \npurpose is to implement or interpret the immigration laws of the United \nStates (as described in INA Sec.  101(a)(17); 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17)) or \nany other function performed by the U.S. Federal Government with \nrespect to aliens.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This TFR does not impose any new reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35. The Department of State will rely on form I-352 from the Department \nof Homeland Security, OMB Control Number 1653-0022, to implement the \nprovisions of this rule. The Department of Homeland Security has \naccounted for this use of the form in its information collection \nrequests to the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 41\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Passports and visas.\n\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department amends 22 \nCFR part 41 to read as follows:\n\nPART 41--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF NONIMMIGRANTS UNDER THE \nIMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 41 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page 37386]]\n\n\n    Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1101; 1102; 1103; 1104; 1182; 1184; 1185 \nnote (section 7209 of Pub. L. 108-458, as amended by section 546 of \nPub. L. 109-295); 1323; 1361; 2651a.\n\n\n0\n2. Amend Sec.  41.11 by adding paragraph (c) to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  41.11  Entitlement to nonimmigrant status.\n\n* * * * *\n    (c) Visa Bond Pilot Program--(1) Summary. This paragraph (c) \nestablishes a pilot program (Visa Bond Pilot Program) beginning August \n20, 2025 and ending August 5, 2026, implementing INA section 221(g)(3). \nUnder the Visa Bond Pilot Program, consular officers will require a \nMaintenance of Status and Departure Bond (Visa Bond) to be posted via \nwww.Pay.Gov and accepted by the Department of State, and with the \nDepartment of the Treasury accepting all monies to be deposited in a \nTreasury-held Department of Homeland Security account for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, as a condition of visa issuance, for \ncertain visa applicants.\n    (2) Visa Bond Pilot Program parameters. Under the Visa Bond Pilot \nProgram, consular officers will require Visa Bonds to be posted by visa \napplicants who are applying for visas as temporary visitors for \nbusiness or pleasure (B-1/B-2) and are nationals of a country that the \nDepartment identifies as:\n    (i) Having high visa overstay rates;\n    (ii) Deficient in its vetting and screening and vetting \ninformation; or\n    (iii) Offering Citizenship by Investment, if the alien obtained \ncitizenship with no residency requirement. Countries deemed to meet \nthese criteria will be identified on the Department's website at \n<a href=\"http://www.travel.state.gov\">www.travel.state.gov</a> no less than 15 days prior to the initiation of \nthe pilot program, and countries may be modified on a rolling basis.\n    (3) Bond amount and visa validity. Consular officers will set the \nVisa Bond amount at $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, based on a consular \nofficer's assessment of which amount is sufficient to ensure the alien \nwill maintain the status under which he or she was admitted or any \nstatus subsequently acquired under section 248 of the INA and will not \nremain in the United States beyond the end of the alien's authorized \nperiod of stay. Visas issued under the Visa Bond Pilot Program will be \nvalid for a single entry to the United States within three months of \nthe date of visa issuance.\n    (4) Bond waiver authority. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa \nServices may waive the bond requirement, for an alien, country, or a \ncategory of aliens, if the Deputy Assistant Secretary assesses that \nsuch a waiver is not contrary to the national interest. A waiver of the \nbond requirement may be recommended to the Deputy Assistant Secretary \nfor Visa Services by a consular officer where the consular officer has \nreason to believe the waiver would advance a national interest or \nhumanitarian interest. There will be no procedure for visa applicants \nto apply for a waiver of the bond requirement. Consular officers will \ndetermine whether a waiver would advance a significant national \ninterest or humanitarian interest based on the applicant's purpose of \ntravel and employment, as described in the visa application and during \nthe visa interview.\n    (5) Bond procedures. A Visa Bond required under this paragraph (c) \nmust be submitted via Treasury's www.Pay.Gov interface within 30 days \nof notification of the bond requirement by the consular officer and \nwill be approved by the Department of State. Upon the posting of such \nbond, State will receive automatic notification that the bond has been \nposted in a Treasury-held Department of Homeland Security account and \nwill notify the appropriate consular section overseas.\n    (i) Under this Visa Bond Pilot Program, Visa Bonds will be \nadministered by the Department of the Treasury, the Department of \nState, and the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with \nregulations, procedures, and instructions promulgated by DHS applicable \nto Form I-352, Immigration Bond.\n    (ii) A Visa Bond will be canceled when a visa holder substantially \nperforms with respect to the terms and conditions of the Visa Bond as \nset forth in Form I-352. Conversely, a Visa Bond will be breached when \nthere has been a substantial violation of the terms and conditions set \nforth in Form I-352. To demonstrate that they complied with the bond \nrequirements, aliens may, for example, depart the United States through \npre-selected ports of entry, or schedule an appointment at a consular \nsection outside the United States within 30 days of his or her \ndeparture from the United States and, after establishing his or her \nidentity through personal appearance and presentation of a passport, \nprovide information to a consular officer confirming he or she departed \nthe United States on or before the expiration of their authorized \nperiod of stay.\n    (1) Upon doing so, visa holders will have substantially performed \nthe bond requirements, provided the visa holder complied with the \nconditions of his or her status during his or her period of authorized \nstay in the United States.\n    (2) Aliens who do not appear at a consular section still may ensure \ncancellation of the bond if he or she substantially complies with the \nterms and conditions of the Visa Bond as set forth in Form I-352.\n    (3) Aliens who timely file an application for extension of status \nwhich is granted are not deemed to be in breach of bond, and the bond \nwill be canceled at the conclusion of his or her authorized period of \nstay.\n    (6) Appeal of bond breach determination. A determination of a bond \nbreach may be appealed in accordance with instructions provided by DHS.\n    (7) Effect on other law. Nothing in this paragraph (c) shall be \nconstrued as altering or affecting any other authority, process, or \nregulation provided by or established under any other provision of \nFederal law.\n\nJohn L. Armstrong,\nSenior Bureau Official, Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of \nState.\n[FR Doc. 2025-14826 Filed 8-4-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4710-05-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>",

    "supplementary_information": "I. Background\n\n    The DV Program is administered by the Department of State. Section \n203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''), 8 U.S.C. 1101 \net seq., makes diversity visas available to aliens who are ``natives'' \nof ``low-admission'' states, subject to certain numerical limitations. \nThe INA defines ``low-admission states'' as those with equal to or \nfewer than 50,000 natives admitted to the United States during the most \nrecent five-year period. INA section 203(c)(1)(B)(ii). Millions of \npetitioners register annually for the DV Program through an electronic \nentry form.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Aliens who enter the DV Program are referred to as \n``petitioners.'' Petitioners in the DV Program who are selected are \nreferred to as ``selectees'' for a Diversity Immigrant Visa. The \nDepartment's Electronic Diversity Visa website. <a href=\"https://dvprogram.state.gov/\">https://dvprogram.state.gov/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Under section 204(a)(1)(I)(iii) of the INA, petitions (also \nreferred to as ``entries'') for the DV Program must be in the form \nprescribed in regulations by the Secretary of State (``Secretary'') and \ncontain all information and be supported by documentary evidence that \nthe Secretary requires. As provided in Department regulations at 22 CFR \n42.33, the entry form collects information on the petitioner's full \nname; date and place of birth; sex; native country, if different from \nplace of birth; current mailing address; and location of the consular \npost nearest to their residence, where the application for a diversity \nimmigrant visa (``DV'') should generally be adjudicated if the \npetitioner is selected and scheduled for an interview through the DV \nProgram. The electronic entry form also collects information about the \nnames, dates, and places of birth of the petitioner's spouse and \nchildren.\n    After the close of the DV Program entry period,\\2\\ certain \npetitioners are selected through a randomized computer drawing \n(``selectees''), and selectees may apply for a DV or, if physically \npresent in the United States and otherwise eligible, may apply to \nadjust status as a diversity immigrant, see INA section 245(a). Under \nsection 201(e) of the INA, the number of available DVs each year is \n55,000.\\3\\ To be issued an immigrant visa as a diversity immigrant, \nindividuals must establish their qualifications and eligibility for the \nvisa in accordance with the INA and Department regulations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ A full description of the Diversity Visa Program, including \ninformation about each step in the process, can be found at: <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html</a>.\n    \\3\\ While section 201(e) of the INA authorizes the allocation of \n55,000 diversity visas annually, up to 5,000 of these visas may be \nset aside for use under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act, as amended by the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. See Public Law 105-100, \n203(d) (1997) (8 U.S.C. 1151 note); Public Law 118-31, 5104 (2023).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII. Fraud and Criminal Entities Hijacking the Process\n\n    The Department has historically encountered significant numbers of \nfraudulent entries for the DV Program each year, including entries \nsubmitted by third parties, some of them criminal enterprises, on \nbehalf of individuals without their knowledge. Unauthorized third \nparties will often then contact the unwitting individual, inform them \nof the opportunity to apply for a DV, and hold the entry information \nfrom the petitioner in exchange for payment or to coerce the petitioner \nto be complicit in certain acts of fraud. This type of fraud is \nprevalent enough that the Federal Trade Commission addressed it in a \n2012 YouTube video about DV fraud.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Diversity Visa Lottery Scams [verbar] Federal Trade \nCommission--YouTube, available at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOnSN8Pbak0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOnSN8Pbak0</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    One of the more egregious examples of large-scale third-party fraud \noccurred in 2012 when Embassy Dhaka (Bangladesh) reported through \nofficial channels that one IP address was responsible for more than \n634,000 entries. Bangladeshi authorities investigated the facilitators \nand found computers with thousands of applications, along with fake \neducation documents and staged marriage photos.\n    Similarly, a Department Office of the Inspector General (OIG) \nreport \\5\\ highlighted Embassy Kyiv's (Ukraine) account of organized \nfraud rings masquerading as travel agencies taking control of the DV \nProgram in Ukraine. By buying, stealing, or otherwise obtaining from \npublic sources, personal information about Ukrainian citizens, the \nfraud ring entered these Ukrainian citizens' names in the online DV \nProgram website, often without their permission or awareness. The fraud \nring then contacted hundreds of Ukrainian selectees and required them \nto pay up to $15,000 to obtain the confirmation number. If the selectee \ncould not pay, the fraud ring often insisted that he or she enter into \na sham marriage with a person who had expressed interest in immigrating \nto the United States. In such a case, the ``sham spouse'' would pay a \nsubstantial amount of money to be paired with a DV selectee. This type \nof fraud continues to be widespread.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ ISP-I-13-45A Department of State, OIG, Inspection of Embassy \nKyiv, Ukraine, September 2013.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Another form of fraud involves the creation or submission of false \ndocuments that the scammer claims will enhance a petitioner's chances \nof selection or approval. This can include counterfeit educational \ndocuments, fake work experience letters, or manipulated photographs as \nevidence of a marital relationship. In 2023, Embassy Phnom Penh \n(Cambodia) reported seeing old ID photos that fixers had photoshopped \nby changing the clothes or background to attempt to circumvent the \nrequirement for a recent photo. The report stated that visa scammers in \nCambodia can charge fees ranging from $5,000 to $30,000 to prepare a DV \ncase, including providing fake education or work documents. Embassy \nChisinau (Moldova) also reported a collaborative effort in 2023 from \ntheir consular section and Overseas Criminal Investigations Unit (OCIU) \nthat detected and thwarted a scheme by a corrupt university official \nwho provided some DV winners with fraudulent diplomas.\n    To protect Americans and U.S. interests from persons who intend to \nthreaten U.S. national security, the Department continues to take steps \nto reduce the fraud in the DV petition and application process. \nRequiring passport information on the DV petition would make it much \nmore difficult for unauthorized third parties to enter someone with \npartial information. This measure would also enable the Department to \nmore effectively and efficiently confirm petitioners' identities. The \nDepartment also anticipates that these measures would decrease the \nnumber of fraudulent marriages encountered in the DV program. \nIdentifying fraudulent petitioners at the petition stage saves time and \neffort on the part of\n\n[[Page 37439]]\n\nadjudicating officers who otherwise dedicate significant resources \ntrying to clarify discrepancies between a petitioner's DV petition and \nthe visa application, and whether the petitioner's explanation is \ncredible or the petition was fraudulent.\n\nIII. Passport Requirement Would Reduce Fraud and Aid in Identity \nVerification\n\n    Under this proposed rule, the Department would amend 22 CFR \n42.33(b)(1) regarding the information required on DV entry forms to \nrequire the petitioner to include the unique serial or issuance number \nassociated with the petitioner's valid, unexpired passport (as defined \nin both INA section101(a)(30) \\6\\ and 22 CFR 42.64(a) \\7\\), the name on \nthe passport, the country or authority of passport issuance, and the \npassport expiration date, as well as a scanned version of the \npassport's biographic and signature page(s). A similar requirement for \na valid passport number was initially put in place as an Interim Final \nRule in 2019,\\8\\ which was vacated on procedural grounds in 2022, \ncorresponding to the 2021, 2022, and 2023 DV Program years.\\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ INA sec. 101(a)(30), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(30 (``The term \n`passport' means any travel document issued by competent authority \nshowing the bearer's origin, identity, and nationality if any, which \nis valid for the admission of the bearer into a foreign country.'').\n    \\7\\ 22 CFR 42.64(a) (``Passport, as defined in INA 101(a)(30), \nis not limited to a national passport or to a single document. A \npassport may consist of two or more documents which, when considered \ntogether, fulfill the requirements of a passport, provided that \ndocumentary evidence of permission to enter a foreign country has \nbeen issued by a competent authority and clearly meets the \nrequirements of INA 101(a)(30).'').\n    \\8\\ See Visas: Diversity Immigrants, 84 FR 25989 (June 5, 2019).\n    \\9\\ See E.B. v. U.S. Dep't of State, 583 F. Supp. 3d 58 (D.D.C. \n2022). In that case, the court held that the 2019 Interim Final Rule \nviolated the Administrative Procedure Act because the Department \nshould have pursued notice and comment rulemaking as it is \nundertaking here. Because the registration period for the 2023 DV \nProgram Year had already taken place at the time of the court's \ndecision, 2024 was the first Program Year in which the Department no \nlonger required a passport at the registration period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    This proposed rule significantly enhances the Department's ability \nto confirm the petitioners' identity as directed under the \nadministration's Executive Order 14161, ``Protecting the United States \nfrom Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety \nThreats,'' signed January 20, 2025, which specifically directs the \nSecretary of State and other agencies to:\n\n    ``(ii) determine the information needed from any country to \nadjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA for \none of its nationals, and to ascertain whether the individual \nseeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and that the \nindividual is not a security or public-safety threat.'' \\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ Exec. Order 14161, 90 FR 8451 (Jan. 20, 2025) (published \nJan. 30, 2025), <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02009/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-other-national-security-and-public-safety\">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02009/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-other-national-security-and-public-safety</a>.\n\n    Mandating valid passport information at the time of the DV Program \nentry would augment vetting and screening processes to ensure national \nsecurity. It would also make it more difficult for third parties to \nsubmit an unauthorized entry because they are less likely to have the \nindividual's unique identifiers, protecting potential petitioners by \nensuring that they alone can enter the program using their unique \ninformation. The information provided via a scanned image enhances \nidentity (and therefore security) by reducing the likelihood of \nproviding a fabricated passport number. As the Department's systems \nmodernize, the Department may explore automatically pre-filling certain \ndata fields [captured from the scan] in the DV Program entry to reduce \ntypographical errors and entrant burden. In addition, the scan \npotentially provides new information--not otherwise collected--that may \nbe relevant and critical to DV adjudication in ways that applicant \nself-disclosure does not provide:\n    Name: The foundation of all national security vetting starts with \nthe applicant's name, which appears in the applicant's native alphabet \non the passport. Requiring a scan of the principal applicant's \nbiographical page will enable adjudicators to compare the spelling of \nthe principal applicant's name in his or her native alphabet on the \npassport with the applicant's own [English-language] spelling in his or \nher petition, which may differ. Having this information will also \nenable the Department to conduct its security and other identity \nvetting measures in reliance on the principal applicant's name as \nprovided in his or her original language, and to identify the various \ntransliterations that may be associated with a particular name. \nTransliteration refers to the process of writing or printing a letter \nor word using the closest corresponding letters of a different alphabet \nor script. Likewise, Romanization, or Latinization, describes the \nprocess by which languages that normally do not use the Latin alphabet \nare converted into Latin letters. There are often several ways to \nRomanize a language. For the Russian language, the Soviet Union \ninvented several systems, and the United Nations and the International \nOrganization for Standardization invented two of the others. There are \nalso several methods for converting names that are Arabic, Japanese, or \nChinese in origin. Some Romanization systems are based on the writing \nsystem of the original language, some are based on speech in the \noriginal language, and some are based on both. In other words, some \nRomanization systems are based on transliteration, and others are based \non transcription. Having the official transcription or transliteration \nof the principal applicant's name will ensure that our security and \nidentity vetting starts with this basic official, verified information.\n    Place of Birth: Like the date of birth, the applicant's place of \nbirth is foundational to our security, identity vetting, and screening. \nThe place of birth is also foundational to the rules relating to \nforeign state of chargeability, including for purposes of determining \nthe foreign state of which the principal applicant is a ``native'' \nunder INA section 203(c). The numerical limitations prescribed in INA \nsections 201, 202, and 203 apply to foreign states and dependent areas. \nAn IV applicant subject to these numerical limitations is generally \nchargeable to the numerical limitation applicable to the applicant's \nplace of birth, with certain exceptions described in INA section \n202(b). An IV applicant born in a dependent area is chargeable to the \ndependent area (to ensure compliance with the dependent-area limitation \nimposed in INA section 202), as well as to the foreign state on which \nthe area is dependent. Currently, entrants to the Diversity Visa \nprogram self-select their foreign state of chargeability from the drop-\ndown list provided on the DS-5501 form, and this information cannot be \nverified until the individual makes his or her application for a visa. \nRequiring verification of this information earlier in the program, via \na scan of the biographic information page of the entrant's valid, \nunexpired passport, will enable the Department to better assess \nselectees' eligibility on the basis of their birth in, and \nchargeability to, a ``low-admission'' foreign state--a fundamental \nrequirement of eligibility for the program under INA section 203(c).\n    Dates of issue and expiration: Issuance and expiration dates, as \ndepicted on a passport scan, provide critical information about the \nstatus of the person in his or her own country that would not otherwise \nbe available to the Department in the review of the applicant's case. \nPassports issued for a limited duration may indicate potential lines of \ninquiry relevant to a DV\n\n[[Page 37440]]\n\nadjudication. For example, passports with a limited duration may be \nissued to fugitives, those indebted to the issuing government or to \nthose who have outstanding child-support obligations. All this \ninformation may lead to information relevant to security, economic or \nother grounds of ineligibility under the INA.\n    Signature Page: The written signature (or usual mark, for those \nunable to sign) in a passport serves several security functions that \nhelp prevent fraud and ensure authenticity. First, it provides a \nunique, personal mark that can be compared against other official \ndocuments to confirm the passport holder's identity. Second, since \nhandwritten signatures are difficult to replicate exactly, they add an \nadditional layer of security against fraudulent passport alterations. \nThird, the signature validates that the passport is issued to the \ncorrect individual. Finally, the written signature page provides \nenhanced security screening by allowing adjudicating officers to \ncompare an applicant's signature with their official records to detect \ndiscrepancies that could indicate identity fraud.\n    In addition to the above benefits derived from requiring a passport \nscan, requiring the unique identifying number of the passport would \nalso enable the Department to more effectively identify and disqualify \nduplicate entries for a given fiscal year, as required under INA \nsection 204(a)(1)(I)(i). The Department's fraud prevention experts \nconfirmed that in the FY25 DV Program, over 2.5 million duplicate \nentries were disqualified pursuant to INA section 204(a)(1)(I)(i). \nComparatively, during the FY22 DV Program, during which the passport \nrequirement was in effect, only 760,079 duplicate entries were \ndisqualified.\n    As a further example of how this rule can directly reduce fraud in \nthe DV program, Embassy Tashkent (Uzbekistan) observed a reduction in \nthe number of DV cases displaying these incomplete data from scammer \nsubmissions in the DV2022 and DV2023 program years, during which the \npassport requirement was in effect. The Embassy reported that the \npassport requirement temporarily forced visa brokers to update the \nbiodata in a DV entrant's registration, disrupting the widespread \npractice of creating DV entries based on old or incomplete data.\n    Under the proposed rule, there would be three exceptions to the \npassport requirement:\n    1. The petitioner is stateless.\n    2. The petitioner is a national of a Communist-controlled country \nand unable to obtain a passport from the government of the Communist-\ncontrolled country.\n    3. The petitioner is the beneficiary of an individual waiver \napproved by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of \nState.\n    These exceptions are consistent with the passport waivers for \nimmigrant visa applicants provided for in 22 CFR 42.2(d), (e), and \n(g)(2). A petitioner must indicate that he or she falls into one of \nthese three circumstances on the electronic entry form instead of \nproviding information from their valid, unexpired passport.\\11\\ A \npetitioner who fails to provide the required information on their entry \nform or who claims an exemption for which they are not later found to \nqualify may be disqualified. Petitioners would be advised to keep a \nscanned copy or photocopy of the passport they use to apply for the DV \nProgram and may be denied if they are unable to produce sufficient \nproof that the passport number on their application was their valid \npassport at time of application.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ If a petitioner indicates on the DS-5501 form that he or \nshe will request a waiver and is randomly selected to participate in \nthe DV program, the consular officer will consider a passport waiver \nupon the petitioner`s completion of a visa application, consistent \nwith 9 FAM 201.2-5 and, if appropriate, submit a request to issue a \nvisa on form DS-232 (Unrecognized Passport or Waiver Cases). When \napproved by the Department and DHS (when necessary), the approval \npermits the use of the DS-232 in lieu of a passport.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Department fraud prevention experts confirm that because most \ncountries' passports adhere to the International Civil Aviation \nOrganizations (ICAO) standards, which require enhanced security \nfeatures and biometric identification, requiring a passport is an \nadditional effort to vet persons applying for entry to the United \nStates and identify those who may intend to threaten our national \nsecurity and U.S. interests. Passport information (via databases, \npersonnel, or actual documents) should be the most guarded and \ndifficult for scammers to access. Asking for a national ID is not as \neffective because not all countries, including the United States, have \na national ID, and the reliability of such documents varies from \ncountry to country, but is generally considered lower than that of the \nnational passport.\n    The Department also considered alternative means to discourage \nunauthorized third-party entries in the DV program but did not identify \nany options that could be implemented in countries with varying \ninternet capacities or alternative unique identifiers that offered the \nsame reliable means to confirm the petitioner's identity. The \nDepartment considered requiring multi-factor authentication, which \nwould require the collection of email addresses and phone numbers. \nHowever, those identifiers are more easily obtained or fraudulently \ncreated by third parties. The Department also considered requiring live \nphotos but ultimately determined that this option was not presently \nviable due to technological limitations in the application process.\n    While the Department anticipates that not all potential DV \npetitioners may have a passport at the time of DV entry, this \nrequirement would significantly advance the Department's ability to \nconfirm the identity of petitioners and conduct screening and vetting \nthat are required for national security.\n    In addition to the passport requirements, the Department would \nsynchronize all language in this chapter to reflect the use of the term \n``sex,'' as directed in Section 2, paragraph (a) in Executive Order \n14168, ``Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring \nBiological Truth to the Federal Government,'' signed January 20, \n2025.\\12\\ The Department also proposes to standardize and amend \nlanguage in 22 CFR part 42 including adding the word ``shall'' to \nsimplify guidance for consular officers and replacing the term ``age'' \nin 22 CFR 42.33(h)(1)(i) with the phrase ``date of birth'' to \naccurately reflect the information collected and maintained by the \nDepartment during the immigrant visa process.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ Exec. Order 14168, 90 FR 8615 (Jan. 20, 2025) (published \nJan. 30, 2025), <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02090/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal\">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02090/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV. Benefits and Costs\n\nBenefits\n\n    The requirement to include information from the alien's valid, \nunexpired passport at the time of entry to the DV Program would protect \nU.S. national security by enabling the Department to confirm a \npetitioner's identity at the entry stage and would help to deter third \nparty or criminal organizations from submitting unauthorized and \nfraudulent entries. The requirement to provide a scanned image enhances \nidentity (and therefore security) by reducing the likelihood of \nproviding a fabricated passport number and will enable adjudicators to \ncompare the spelling of the principal applicant's name in his or her \nnative alphabet on the passport with the applicant's own English-\nlanguage spelling in his or her\n\n[[Page 37441]]\n\npetition. Having this information will also enable the Department to \nconduct its security and other identity vetting measures in reliance on \nthe principal applicant's name as provided in his or her original \nlanguage, and to identify the various transliterations that may be \nassociated with a particular name.\n    Additionally, knowing an alien's place of birth will enable the \nconsular adjudicator to confirm the foreign state of which the \nprincipal applicant is a ``native'' under INA section 203(c). The \nnumerical limitations prescribed in INA sections 201, 202, and 203 \napply to foreign states and dependent areas. An IV applicant subject to \nthese numerical limitations is generally chargeable to his or her place \nof birth, with certain exceptions described in INA section 202(b). An \nIV applicant born in a dependent area is chargeable to the dependent \narea (to ensure compliance with the dependent-area limitation imposed \nin INA section 202), as well as to the foreign state on which the area \nis dependent. Currently, entrants to the Diversity Visa program self-\nselect their foreign state of chargeability from the drop-down list \nprovided on the DS-5501 form, and this information cannot be verified \nuntil the individual makes his or her application for a visa. Requiring \nverification of this information earlier in the program, via a scan of \nthe biographic information page of the entrant's valid, unexpired \npassport, will enable the Department to better assess selectees' \neligibility on the basis of their birth in, and chargeability to, a \n``low-admission'' foreign state--a fundamental requirement of \neligibility for the program under INA section 203(c).\\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ The Department acknowledges there may be cases in which the \npetitioner may benefit from chargeability derived from a spouse or \nother family member, consistent with INA 202(b) and 22 CFR 42.12.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Finally, collection of the dates of issue and expiration can \nprovide critical information about the status of the person in his or \nher own country that would not otherwise be available to the Department \nin the review of the applicant's case. For example, passports issued \nfor a limited duration period may indicate potential lines of inquiry \nthat a consular officer finds relevant to a DV adjudication. All this \ninformation may lead to information relevant to security, economic or \nother grounds of ineligibility under the INA. The requirement to \ncollect the signature page likewise serves several security functions \nand ensures both authenticity and that the passport was issued to the \ncorrect individual.\n\nCosts\n\n    This proposed regulation would require some petitioners to obtain a \npassport at the time of application to the DV Program rather than after \nbeing selected for an interview. According to research conducted by the \nVisa Office of the Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, the average \nprice of a passport in countries that are eligible to participate in \nthe DV Program is $74.43.\\14\\ The Department seeks public comment on \nthe accuracy of its estimate of the average price of a passport in DV \nProgram eligible countries as well as the unquantified burdens of \nobtaining a passport in those countries.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ Statistics were compiled by reviewing publicly available \ninformation provided by foreign governments of DV-eligible \ncountries. Currency conversions were completed using a leading \ncommercial currency conversion source. For many countries, the fee \nfor obtaining a passport was not clearly available on public \nsources. The Department also notes that there may be additional \ncosts to obtaining a passport beyond the stated fee; the Department \nis unable to quantify such additional, unstated, or opportunity \ncosts.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Department estimates that, on average, responding to the new \nrequirements in this information collection request would take \napproximately twenty minutes, which includes gathering the passport, \nsupplying the number in the application, photographing or scanning the \npassport and uploading the image file. The Department estimates five \nminutes for the gathering of the passport and supplying the number and \nfifteen minutes for scanning and submitting the image. The Department \nassumes that most entrants will be able to quickly scan the passport \nwith a single photo taken by a mobile phone. The International Civil \nAviation Organization's passport specifications indicate that the \nsignature will normally be on the biographic data page, though it may \nalso be placed on the page adjacent to or on the back of the data page. \nWhen the signature is not on or adjacent to the data page, the entrant \nwill need to combine two images into one. Although this can be \naccomplished on a mobile phone, it will take more time and skill, and \nit is possible that some entrants will seek assistance from a third \nparty. The Department seeks comment on its estimate of these costs, \nincluding the prevalence of mobile phone usage among the population of \nDV program entrants.\n    To place a cost value on this effort, the Department analyzed wage \ndata from the International Labor Organization \\15\\ for countries \neligible to participate in the DV Program for DV-2025.\\16\\ After \nfiltering out non-DV eligible countries, 193 countries and territories \nremained. The ILO data set indicated the most recent year each \ncountry's data was obtained, which ranged from 2013 to 2023, with most \nof the data points being from 2018 and later. The analysis used average \nhourly wage when available; if not, minimum hourly wage was \nsubstituted. Most of the data was reported in U.S. dollars. For wages \nnot listed in U.S. dollars, the wage listed was converted into U.S. \ndollars using average conversion rates from the year the data was \nobtained. The calculated wage was then averaged across all of the DV-\neligible countries and determined to be $4.56 per hour. When converted \nto the 20-minute additional time burden, it yielded a time cost of \n$1.52 per response. Multiplied by the number of potential respondents \nbased on the most recent cycles (25,000,000), the Department estimates \nthe additional time cost at $38,000,000 globally.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See ILO.Org Wage Data Set: <a href=\"https://rplumber.ilo.org/data/indicator/?id=EAR_4HRL_SEX_OCU_CUR_NB_A&sex=SEX_T&classif1=OCU_SKILL_TOTAL&classif2=CUR_TYPE_LCU+CUR_TYPE_USD&type=label&format=.csv\">https://rplumber.ilo.org/data/indicator/?id=EAR_4HRL_SEX_OCU_CUR_NB_A&sex=SEX_T&classif1=OCU_SKILL_TOTAL&classif2=CUR_TYPE_LCU+CUR_TYPE_USD&type=label&format=.csv</a>.\n    \\16\\ See Department's DV-2025 Program Instructions: <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/dv-2025-instructions-translations/DV-2025_Instructions-faqs.pdf\">https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/dv-2025-instructions-translations/DV-2025_Instructions-faqs.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRequirement Not Expected To Negatively Impact Program Outcomes\n\n    The Department does not believe that this requirement would \nsubstantially deter participation by legitimate petitioners, and the \nDepartment notes that petitioners who are selected are already required \nto have a passport before moving forward in the process. While the \nDepartment recognizes that the increased burden and cost of obtaining a \npassport before entering the DV program could, for the marginally \nlegitimate entrant, deter participation and result in fewer annual \nentrants overall, the Department expects that all the available DVs \nwill continue to be utilized and security of the program will be \nstrengthened. The Department is unaware of reliable data on the rates \nof passport ownership in DV Program countries. To help better inform \nthe analysis of benefits and costs of this rule, the Department seeks \ncomment from the public on the rates of passport ownership in such \ncountries. As mentioned above in Section III, this requirement was \ninitially put in\n\n[[Page 37442]]\n\nplace in 2019 \\17\\ and was in effect for the 2021, 2022, and 2023 DV \nProgram years.\\18\\ During this time, the Department was able to compare \nparticipation levels \\19\\ both prior to and during the period in which \naliens were required to include passport information with their DV \nentry:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ See Visas: Diversity Immigrants, 84 FR 25989 (June 5, \n2019).\n    \\18\\ See E.B. v.

Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Secretary of State has determined that all policy related to \nvisa operations and issuance, among other matters, constitutes a \nforeign affairs function of the United States under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553).\\21\\ However, due to the Department's \ninterest in seeking public comment on this rulemaking, the Department \nis soliciting comments during a 45-day comment period, to which it will \nrespond in a final rule, should the Department choose to finalize all \nor part of this proposal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See Determination: Foreign Affairs Function of the United \nStates, 90 FR 12200 (Mar. 14, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    This proposed rule would not regulate ``small entities'' as that \nterm is defined in 5 U.S.C. 601(6) and as such would not have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \nThis NPRM only proposes to regulate individual visa applicants. The \nDepartment affirms that this proposed rule would not have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\nC. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1532, generally \nrequires agencies to prepare a statement before proposing any rule that \nmay result in an annual expenditure of $100 million or more by State, \nlocal, or Tribal governments, or by the private sector. This proposed \nrule does not require the Department to prepare a statement because it \nwould not result in any such expenditure, nor would it significantly or \nuniquely affect small governments. This proposed rule involves visas, \nwhich involve foreign individuals, and does not directly or \nsubstantially affect state, local, or Tribal governments, or \nbusinesses.\n\nD. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and Executive \nOrder 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), direct agencies to assess \nthe costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. These Executive Orders stress the importance of \nquantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing \nrules, and of promoting flexibility. The Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs has determined that this is a significant regulatory \naction under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. A discussion of the \nestimated costs and benefits of the proposed rule can be found above \nand the Department welcomes comments, including alternative estimates, \non its analysis.\n\nE. Executive Orders 12372 and 13132: Federalism\n\n    This proposed regulation would not have substantial direct effects \non the States, on the relationship between the national government and \nthe States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. This proposed rule would also not have \nfederalism implications warranting the application of Executive Orders \n12372 and 13132.\n\n[[Page 37443]]\n\nF. Executive Order 12988: Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed this proposed rule in light of sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburdens.\n\nG. Executive Order 14192--Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation\n\n    This rule is exempt from Executive Order 14192 as it is a \nregulation issued with respect to a foreign affairs, national security, \nhomeland security and immigration-related function of the United \nStates.\n\nH. Executive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments\n\n    The Department has determined that this proposed rule would not \nhave Tribal implications, would not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian Tribal governments, and would not pre-empt \nTribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive \nOrder 13175 do not apply to this rulemaking.\n\nI. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    The Department invites comment on any burden estimates included in \nthe proposed collection of information. Comments are encouraged and \nwill be accepted for 45 days from the publication date of this NPRM. \nAll submission must include the OMB Control Number 1405-0153 in the \nbody of the letter and the agency name.

The two primary \nrequirements of the program are: (1) the petitioner is a native of a \nlow admission country, and (2) has at least a high school education or \nits equivalent, or within five years of the date of an application for \na visa has two years of work experience in an occupation which requires \nat least two years of training or experience. The Department is \nproposing to amend the DS-5501 to require that entrants provide \ninformation for a valid, unexpired passport consistent with the notice \nof proposed rulemaking above. The Department of State randomly selects \nqualified petitioners for further participation in the program.\nMethodology\n    The DS-5501 is available online at <a href=\"http://www.dvprogram.state.gov\">www.dvprogram.state.gov</a> and can \nonly be submitted electronically during the annual entry period.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Immigration, Passports and visas.\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department proposes to \namend 22 CFR part 42 to read as follows:\n\nPART 42--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION \nAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for Part 42 reads as follows:\n\n    Authority:  22 U.S.C. 2651a; 8 U.S.C. 1104; 8 U.S.C. 1151; 8 \nU.S.C. 1153-1154; Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681-795 through 2681-\n801; 8 U.S.C. 1185 note (section 7209 of Pub. L. 108-458, as amended \nby section 546 of Pub. L. 109-295).\n\n\nSec.  42.33  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. Revise Sec.  42.33 to read as follows:\n    (a) General--\n    (1) Eligibility to compete for consideration under section 203(c). \nAn alien will be eligible to compete for consideration for visa \nissuance under INA 203(c) during a fiscal year only if he or she is a \nnative of a low-admission foreign state, as determined by the Secretary \nof Homeland Security pursuant to INA 203(c)(1)(E), with respect to the \nfiscal year in question; and if he or she has at least a high school \neducation or its equivalent or, within the five years preceding the \ndate of application for a visa, has two years of work experience in an \noccupation requiring at least two years training or experience. The \neligibility for a visa under INA 203(c) ceases at the end of the fiscal \nyear in question. Under no circumstances may a consular officer issue a \nvisa or other documentation to an alien after the end of the fiscal \nyear during which an alien possesses diversity visa eligibility.\n    (2) Definition of high school education or its equivalent. For the \npurposes of this section, the phrase high school education or its \nequivalent means the successful completion of a twelve-year course of \nelementary and secondary education in the United States or successful \ncompletion in another country of a formal course of elementary and \nsecondary education comparable to completion of twelve years' \nelementary and secondary education in the United States.\n    (3) Determinations of work experience. Consular officers shall use \nthe Department of Labor's O*Net On Line to determine qualifying work \nexperience.\n    (4) Limitation on number of petitions per year. No more than one \npetition may be submitted by, or on behalf of, any alien for \nconsideration during any single fiscal year. If two or more petitions \nfor any single fiscal year are submitted by, or on behalf of, any \nalien, all such petitions will be void pursuant to INA 204(a)(1)(I)(i) \nand the alien by or for whom the petition has been submitted will not \nbe eligible for consideration for diversity visa issuance during the \nfiscal year in question.\n    (5) Northern Ireland. For purposes of determining eligibility to \nfile a petition for consideration under INA 203(c) for a fiscal year, \nthe districts comprising that portion of the United Kingdom of Great \nBritain and Northern Ireland, known as ``Northern Ireland,'' will be \ntreated as a separate foreign state. The districts comprising \n``Northern Ireland'' are Antrim, Ards, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, \nBanbridge, Belfast, Carrickfergus, Castlereagh, Coleraine, Cookstown, \nCraigavon, Down, Dungannon, Fermanagh, Larne, Limavady, Lisburn, \nLondonderry, Magherafelt, Moyle, Newry and Mourne,\n\n[[Page 37444]]\n\nNewtownabbey, North Down, Omagh, and Strabane.\n    (b) Petition requirement. An alien claiming to be entitled to \ncompete for consideration under INA 203(c) must file a petition with \nthe Department of State for such consideration. At the alien \npetitioner's request, another person may file a petition on behalf of \nthe alien.

    "supplementary_information": "I. Special Immigrant Visas for Certain Employees or Former Employees of \nthe United States Abroad, and for the Surviving Spouses or Children of \nCertain Deceased Employees of the U.S. Government Abroad\n\nA. Legal Authority\n\n    Section 203(b)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as \namended 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(4), generally provides that visas may be \nissued to qualified special immigrants described in INA section \n101(a)(27). Among the individuals considered ``special immigrants'' as \ndefined in this provision, INA section 101(a)(27)(D), 8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)(27)(D), defines ``special immigrant'' to include employees, or \nhonorably retired former employees, of the U.S. Government abroad, or \nof the American Institute in Taiwan, who have performed faithful \nservice for a total of fifteen years or more, in addition to their \naccompanying spouse and children, and who have been recommended and \napproved for such status in accordance with enumerated criteria.\n    Section 403(a) of the Emergency Security Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, 2021 (``ESSAA''), Public Law 117-31, 135 Stat. 309, \n318, amended the definition of a special immigrant at INA section \n101(a)(27)(D) to include a new subclause (ii). The new subclause \nincludes in the definition of ``special immigrant'' the surviving \nspouse or child of an employee of the United States Government abroad: \nProvided, [t]hat the employee performed faithful service for a total of \nnot less than 15 years or was killed in the line of duty.'' Under this \nprovision, the qualifying surviving spouse or child of a U.S. \nGovernment employee is a principal applicant for special immigrant \nstatus, and consequently, their current spouse and minor child(ren) are \nentitled to SIVs as derivatives under INA section 203(d), 8 U.S.C. \n1153(d), if accompanying or following to join the qualifying surviving \nspouse or parent. Pursuant to section 403(d) of the ESSAA, these \nchanges are effective June 30, 2021, and have retroactive effect.\n    In addition to the qualifications for this group of ``special \nimmigrants,'' INA section 204(a)(1)(G)(ii) governs the process through \nwhich an individual claiming status as a special immigrant under INA \nsection 101(a)(27)(D) must file a petition with the Department of \nState, requiring that they first be recommended and approved for such \nstatus.\n\nB. Processing for Special Immigrants Under INA Section 101(a)(27)(D)\n\n    Under INA sections 204(a)(1)(G)(ii) and 101(a)(27)(D)(i), \nacquisition of special immigrant status under INA section 101(a)(27)(D) \nrequires multiple sequential steps. First, the principal officer of the \nU.S. embassy or consulate with jurisdiction over where the individual \nwas employed must have recommended the granting of special immigrant \nstatus in exceptional circumstances, and the Secretary of State or \nappropriate designee must have approved the recommendation and found \nthat it is in the national interest to grant such status. Second, under \nINA section 204(a)(1)(G)(ii), only after the approval of the \nrecommendation, the applicant may submit a Form DS-1884, Petition to \nClassify Special Immigrant Under INA 203(b)(4) as an Employee or Former \nEmployee of the U.S. Government Abroad, or the Surviving Spouse or \nChild of an Employee of the U.S. Government Abroad, to a consular \nofficer at a foreign service post. Under Department regulations at 22 \nCFR 42.34(b)(2), the date the applicant's properly completed DS-1884 is \naccepted becomes the applicant's priority date. Those same regulations \nat 22 CFR 42.34(b)(4) provide that a petition from a qualifying \nindividual is valid for six months from the date of approval or the \ndate an immigrant visa number becomes available, whichever is later.\n\nC. What is the impact of the ESSAA?\n\n    Prior to passage of the ESSAA, if the employee were to die before \nentering the United States using their immigrant visa, the surviving \nspouse or child would be ineligible for immigrant status. With the \npassage of the ESSAA, a surviving spouse and surviving child(ren), as a \nprincipal applicant, are eligible to seek qualification as a special \nimmigrant. Additionally, in situations where the employee did not \npursue special immigrant status prior to the employee's death, their \nsurviving spouse and/or child may now qualify to be approved for \nstatus. These changes apply retroactively, meaning that the surviving \nspouse or child of an employee who died prior to the effective date of \nthe ESSAA may also seek to qualify. To be a surviving spouse, the \nspousal relationship must have existed at the time of the deceased \nemployee's death. To be a surviving child, the adult son or daughter of \nthe deceased employee must have met the definition of ``child'' under \nINA section 101(b)(1) on the date of the employee's death.\n\nII. Changes the Department Is Making\n\nA. 22 CFR 42.11\n\n    This rule makes updates to the Department's regulations at 22 CFR \n42.11 that list the symbols of the current immigrant visa \nclassifications to conform with the new classifications added by the \nESSAA. Specifically, under the ``Employment 4th Preference (Certain \nSpecial Immigrants)'' header, the Department is adding: The ``SS1'' \nsymbol that will be used for issuance of SIVs to the surviving spouse \nor child of a U.S. Government employee; the ``SS2'' symbol that will be \nused for issuance of an SIV to the current spouse of an SS1 who \nqualifies as a derivative under INA 203(d); and the ``SS3'' symbol that \nwill be used for issuance of an SIV to the minor child(ren) of an SS1 \nwho meet(s) the definition of ``child'' under INA 101(b)(1) and 203(h), \nand qualify(ies) as a derivative under INA 203(d).\n\nB. 22 CFR 42.34\n\n    This rule makes changes to Department regulations at 22 CFR 42.34 \nto conform with the expanded definition of ``special immigrant'' under \nthe ESSAA. For the reasons explained below, the Department believes \nthese (or\n\n[[Page 99077]]\n\nequivalent) changes are necessary to implement the best reading of the \nESSAA. The changes include the explanation of the classification of a \nsurviving spouse or child of an employee of the United States \nGovernment abroad who was killed in the line of duty, or who performed \nfaithful service for at least fifteen years before their death.\n    As summarized above, the ESSAA added a new subsection (ii) to INA \n101(a)(27)(D) and amended INA 101(a)(27)(D) to specify that a ``special \nimmigrant'' includes an individual described in clause (D)(i) ``or'' \nclause (D)(ii). The ESSAA did not amend INA 204(a)(1)(G)(ii), which \ngoverns the process through which an individual petitions for status \n``as a special immigrant under INA 101(a)(27)(D).'' Consequently, as \nthis provision was not amended to distinguish the petition process for \nspecial immigrants described in INA 101(a)(27)(D)(i) or INA \n101(a)(27)(D)(ii), INA 204(a)(1)(G)(ii) continues to govern the \npetition process for both subcategories of ``special immigrants'' \ndescribed in section 101(a)(27)(D), providing that applicants seeking \nstatus under either subcategory ``may file a petition . . . only after \nnotification by the Secretary of State that such status has been \nrecommended and approved pursuant to such section.'' Although INA \n101(a)(27)(D)(ii) as amended does not expressly reference a framework \nfor recommendation and approval, INA 101(a)(27)(D)(i) establishes the \nstandards for a recommendation and approval process, including that the \nrecommendation of an individual for special immigrant status be made in \n``exceptional circumstances'' and the approval be ``in the national \ninterest,'' as well as identifies officers vested with authority for \nthose respective functions. Incorporating into INA 101(a)(27)(D)(ii) \nthe standards and process for recommendation and approval expressly \nprovided by Congress in INA 101(a)(27)(D)(i) reflects the best reading \nof the statutory framework as amended by ensuring consistency with the \ncompanion provision in INA 204(a)(1)(G)(ii) requiring recommendation \nand approval of such cases and ensuring the consistent application of \nthe longstanding framework for the granting of special immigrant visas \nto U.S. Government employees.\n    To address potential inconsistencies in how this change would be \nimplemented using the existing definition of ``exceptional \ncircumstances'' at 22 CFR 42.34(c)(7), this rule explains the \ncircumstances in which a surviving spouse or child would be recommended \nfor special immigrant status, based on the criteria described in INA \nsection 101(a)(27)(D)(ii). In addition to qualifying employees' deaths \nthat occurred in the line of duty, these include when the deceased \nemployee performed at least 15 years of faithful service for the U.S. \nGovernment and either would have qualified for special immigrant status \nbefore dying or was employed by the U.S. Government as of the date of \ntheir death or in the immediately preceding five-year period. These \nparameters will encompass those family members of deceased employees \nwho, but for their death following at least 15 years of faithful \nservice, were likely to have soon qualified for special immigrant \nstatus by accumulating 20 years of faithful service (where 20 years is \na strong indicator of exceptional circumstances under 22 CFR \n42.34(c)(7)(ii)(E)). This standard encompasses those who were employed \nby the U.S. Government in the period immediately preceding their death, \nas the Department anticipates that in some cases, an employee may have \nceased employment by the U.S. Government with the intention of \nreturning, but for circumstances out of their control. For example, an \nemployee who dies following a serious illness may have ceased or \ntemporarily left their employment for a period to combat their illness. \nConsequently, to provide clarity to the public and support consistent \napplication, the rule establishes a rebuttable presumption that a death \noccurring more than five years after cessation of employment is not \nrelated to the cessation of their employment for purposes of their \nsurviving spouse or child qualifying for special immigrant status.\n    The Department believes this five-year presumption will account for \nthe gravity and severity of the circumstances surrounding cessation of \nemployment, and the likelihood that a previously employed individual \nwould have returned to work to complete 20 years of service, if they \nwere able to do so. This presumption is rebuttable and will require \ncase-specific consideration of those individuals whose circumstances \nfall outside the five-year presumption and who wish to provide evidence \nto establish their qualifications. Surviving spouses and children of \nemployees who died for reasons unrelated to cessation of employment are \nnot precluded from qualifying as special immigrants, provided they can \ndemonstrate that the employee demonstrated at least one form of \n``exceptional circumstances'' while still employed. The changes also \nhighlight that the processes to qualify for eligibility are the same \nfor a surviving spouse or child as they are for employees. These \nchanges make necessary amendments to 22 CFR 42.34 to provide for the \nissuance of SIVs to qualified surviving spouses and children of U.S. \nGovernment employees, and to reflect the amended citations in INA \nsection 101(a)(27)(D) under the ESSAA.\n    This rule also makes corrections throughout 22 CFR 42.34 to replace \nthe term ``alien'' with the term ``applicant'' or ``employee,'' as \nappropriate. This change is consistent with current Department \npractice.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See 88 FR 45072 (July 14, 2023).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Finally, this rule also amends the certification, required as part \nof the principal officer's recommendation, that the individual being \nrecommended is prepared to pursue an immigrant visa application \n``within one year of the Department's notification to the post of \napproval of special immigrant status.'' As applicants in numerically \nlimited immigrant visa categories, including INA section 203(b)(4), may \nnot pursue an immigrant visa application until such time that a visa \nnumber becomes available in that category, this requirement has been \nchanged to reflect that the recommended individual must be prepared to \npursue their application ``within one year of the Department's \nnotification to the post of approval of special immigrant status, or of \nan immigrant visa becoming available, whichever is later.''\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nA. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rule is exempted from the notice and comment and delayed \neffective date rulemaking procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 553 because \nthe rule involves a foreign affairs function. 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This \nexemption applies when the rule's subject matter ``is clearly and \ndirectly involved in a foreign affairs function.'' Mast Indus. v. \nRegan, 596 F. Supp. 1567, 1582 (C.I.T. 1984) (quotation marks omitted). \nIn addition, although the text of the APA does not require an agency \ninvoking this exemption to show that rulemaking with public notice and \ncomment would result in ``definitely undesirable international \nconsequences,'' some courts have required such a showing. See, e.g., \nYassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1360 n.4 (9th Cir. 1980). This rule \nsatisfies both standards.\n\n[[Page 99078]]\n\n    This rule extends the authority to grant special immigrant status \nto the surviving spouse or child of a U.S. Government employee who \nperformed faithful service for at least fifteen years or was killed in \nthe line of duty. As with the availability of special immigrant status \nto qualifying locally employed staff, eligibility for employees' \nsurviving spouses and children encourages employees to remain in their \njobs and to provide long-term, institutional memory to U.S. Government \nagencies abroad. This is particularly essential in countries where \nlocal staff members and their families face retribution by the host \ngovernment, making it even more challenging to recruit and retain a \nlocally employed workforce. For this reason, extending eligibility to \nthe employee's surviving spouse and children critically impacts the \nwillingness of foreign nationals to become, and remain, employees of \nthe U.S. Government in overseas posts, and hence directly impacts the \neffectiveness of U.S. diplomatic efforts in those countries.\n    The Department's establishment of criteria for surviving spouses \nand child(ren) to qualify for special immigrant status under ESSAA \nclearly and directly relates to U.S. foreign affairs, because the \ncriteria itself is critical for the U.S. Government to recruit and \nretain loyal, valuable local staff outside the United States, without \nwhom the Department could not fulfill its diplomatic functions \noverseas. The Department alone employs approximately 50,000 local staff \nat over 200 Foreign Service posts overseas. Expanded qualifications for \nsurviving spouses and child(ren) is critical to recruitment, retention, \nand morale of these locally employed staff who help the Department \ncarry out its foreign affairs functions overseas. For example, \nfollowing the 2013 death of Mustafa Akarsu, a member of the local guard \nforce for U.S. Embassy Ankara for 22 years, when he confronted a \nsuicide bomber outside the Embassy, Department employee organizations \nincluding the American Foreign Service Association, advocated for \npassage of legislation eventually enacted in ESSAA to provide SIVs to \nthe surviving spouses and children of U.S. Government employees killed \nin the line of duty. Consequently, implementation of these standards \nfor surviving family members clearly and directly involves a U.S. \nforeign affairs function.\n    Finally, the Department considers that providing the opportunity \nfor public notice and comment would provide ``definitely undesirable \ninternational consequences,'' in that conducting and resolving a public \ndebate regarding the safety of surviving spouses and children of U.S. \nGovernment employees killed abroad would risk impairing U.S. relations \nwith other countries. See, e.g., Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 437 \n(2d Cir. 2008). The loss of United States local employees in the line \nof duty has previously had the effect of straining bilateral relations, \nand has the continued potential to do so, particularly when such losses \ninvolve local foreign authorities or other parties over which the host \ncountry exercises control. This may be even more so in countries with \nwhich the United States already has sensitive or strained relations, \nwhich may oppose the availability of immigrant visas to the surviving \nspouses and children of such staff, who are usually nationals of the \nhost country. Accordingly, the promulgation of standards for approval \nunder the Secretary of State's authority in INA 101(a)(27)(D) involves \nan inherently foreign affairs function of the Department of State.\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    As this final rule is exempt from notice and comment rulemaking \nunder 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1), it is exempt from the regulatory flexibility \nanalysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 \nU.S.C. 601 et seq.). Nonetheless, as this action only directly impacts \nvisa applicants, the Department certifies that this rule will not have \na significant economic impact on a substantial number of small U.S. \nentities.\n\nC. Congressional Review Act of 1996\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 804. This rule \nwill not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or \nmore; a major increase in costs or prices; or adverse effects on \ncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the \nability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign-based \ncompanies in domestic and import markets.\n\nD. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), and 14094 (Modernizing \nRegulatory Review)\n\n    This rule has been drafted in accordance with the principles of \nExecutive Orders 12866 (as amended by Executive Order 14094) and 13563. \nThe Department has submitted this rule to OIRA for review and it has \nbeen deemed a significant regulatory action.\n\nE. Executive Order 12988: Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department of State has reviewed the rule considering sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburdens.\n\nF. Executive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments\n\n    The Department of State has determined that this rulemaking will \nnot have Tribal implications, will not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian Tribal Governments, and will not pre-empt \nTribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive \nOrder 13175 do not apply to this rulemaking.\n\nG. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. \nChapter 35. The Form DS-1884, Petition to Classify Special Immigrant \nunder INA 203(b)(4) as an Employee or Former Employee of the U.S. \nGovernment Abroad, is approved under the PRA (OMB Control No. 1405-\n0082).\n\nH. Other\n\n    The Department has also considered the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \nof 1995 and Executive Orders 12372 and 13132 and affirms this rule is \nconsistent with the applicable mandates or guidance therein.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Passports and visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, 22 CFR part \n42 is amended as follows:\n\nPART 42--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION \nAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.

Section 42.34 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  42.34  Special immigrant visas-certain U.S. Government employees.\n\n    (a) General. An applicant is classifiable under INA 203(b)(4) as a \nspecial immigrant described in INA 101(a)(27)(D) provided:\n    (1) (i) The applicant has performed faithful service to the United \nStates Government abroad, or the American Institute in Taiwan, for a \ntotal of fifteen years or more; or\n    (ii) The applicant is the surviving spouse or child of an employee \nof the United States Government abroad who performed faithful service \nfor a total of not less than 15 years or was killed in the line of \nduty; and\n    (2) The principal officer of a Foreign Service establishment (or, \nin the case of the American Institute in Taiwan, the Director), \nrecommends granting special immigrant status to such person in \nexceptional circumstances; and\n    (3) The Secretary of State, or designee, approves such \nrecommendation and finds that it is in the national interest to grant \nsuch status.\n    (b) Petition requirement. An applicant who seeks classification as \na special immigrant described in paragraph (a) of this section must \nfile a Form DS-1884, Petition to Classify Special Immigrant under INA \n203(b)(4) as an Employee or Former Employee of the U.S. Government \nAbroad, or the Surviving Spouse or Child of an Employee of the U.S. \nGovernment Abroad, with the Department of State. An applicant described \nin INA 101(a)(27)(D) may file such a petition only after, but within \none year of, notification from the Department that the Secretary of \nState or designee has approved a recommendation from the principal \nofficer that special immigrant status be accorded the applicant in \nexceptional circumstances and has found it in the national interest to \ndo so.\n    (1) Petition fees. The Secretary of State shall establish a fee for \nthe filing of a petition to accord status under INA 203(b)(4) which \nshall be collected following notification that the Secretary of State, \nor designee, has approved the recommendation that the applicant be \ngranted status as a special immigrant under INA 101(a)(27)(D).\n    (2) Establishing priority date. The priority date of an applicant \nseeking status under INA 203(b)(4) as a special immigrant described in \nINA 101(a)(27)(D) shall be the date on which the petition to accord \nsuch classification, the DS-1884, is filed. The filing date of the \npetition is the date on which a properly completed form and the \nrequired fee are accepted by a Foreign Service post. Pursuant to INA \n203(d), and whether named in the petition, the current spouse or child \nwho meets the definition of ``child'' under INA 101(b)(1) of an \napplicant classified under INA 203(b)(4), if not otherwise entitled to \nan immigrant status and the immediate issuance of a visa, is entitled \nto the classification and priority date of the beneficiary of the \npetition.\n    (3) Delegation of authority to approve petitions. The authority to \napprove petitions to accord status under INA 203(b)(4) to an applicant \ndescribed in INA 101(a)(27)(D) is hereby delegated to the chief \nconsular officer at the post of recommendation or, in the absence of \nthe consular officer, to any alternate approving officer designated by \nthe principal officer. Such authority may not be exercised until the \nForeign Service post has received formal notification of the Secretary \nof State or designee's approval of special immigrant status for the \npetitioning applicant.\n    (4) Petition validity. Except as noted in this paragraph, the \nvalidity of a petition approved for classification under INA 203(b)(4) \nshall be six months beyond the date of the Secretary of State's \napproval thereof or the availability of a visa number, whichever is \nlater.\n    (5) Extension of special immigrant status and petition validity. If \nthe principal officer of a post concludes that circumstances in a \nparticular case are such that an extension of validity of the Secretary \nof State or designee's approval of the principal officer's \nrecommendation or of the petition would be in the national interest, \nthe\n\n[[Page 99080]]\n\nprincipal officer shall recommend to the Secretary of State or designee \nthat such validity be extended for not more than one additional year.\n    (c) Definitions--(1) Full-time service. Where 15 years of service \nis the minimum time required for eligibility for a special immigrant \nvisa, the employee must have been employed for a total of at least 15 \nfull-time years, or the equivalent thereof, in the service of the U.S. \nGovernment abroad. The number of hours per week that qualify an \nemployee as full-time is dependent on local law and prevailing practice \nin the country where the individual is or was employed, as reflected in \nthe employment documentation submitted with the application for special \nimmigrant status. The years of service may be met based on employment \nabroad with one, or more than one, agency of the U.S. Government \nprovided the total amount of full-time service with the U.S. Government \nis 15 years or more, or the equivalent thereof.\n    (2) Faithful service. Where faithful service is required for \neligibility for a special immigrant visa, an employee must have \nperformed faithfully in the position held. The principal officer has \nthe primary responsibility for determining whether the employee's \nservice meets this requirement. A record of disciplinary actions that \nhave been taken against the employee does not automatically disqualify \nthe applicant. The principal officer must assess the record of \ndisciplinary actions considering the extent and gravity of the \nmisconduct and when the incidents occurred, and determine whether the \nrecord as a whole, notwithstanding disciplinary actions, is one of \nfaithful service.\n    (3) Continuity. Where 15 years of service is the minimum time \nrequired for eligibility for a special immigrant visa, the employee's \nperiod of service need not have been continuous but must have an \naggregate total of 15 years of service to qualify.\n    (4) Abroad. The service must have occurred anywhere outside the \nUnited States, as the term ``United States'' is defined in INA \n101(a)(38).\n    (5) Employment at the American Institute in Taiwan. INA \n101(a)(27)(D) permits both present and former employees of the American \nInstitute in Taiwan to apply for special immigrant status. An \nemployee's service before and after the founding of the American \nInstitute in Taiwan is counted toward the minimum 15 years of service \nrequirement.\n    (6) Honorably retired. Separations within the meaning of \n``honorably retired'' include, for example, those resulting from \nmandatory or voluntary retirement, reduction-in-force, or resignation \nfor personal reasons. Separations not within the meaning of ``honorably \nretired'' would include a termination for cause or an involuntary \ntermination or resignation in lieu of a termination for cause.\n    (7) Exceptional circumstances for employees of the United States \nGovernment abroad. For classification as a special immigrant under INA \n101(a)(27)(D)(i), the principal officer must determine that an employee \ndemonstrates at least one form of ``exceptional circumstances'' to \nsupport an application for special immigrant status.\n    (i) Prima facie indicators of exceptional circumstances. In the \nfollowing situations, an employee's service with the U.S. Government \ngenerally will be deemed to have met exceptional circumstances.\n    (A) Diplomatic relations between the employee's country of \nnationality and the United States have been severed;\n    (B) Diplomatic relations between the country in which the employee \nwas employed and the United States have been severed;\n    (C) The country in which the employee was employed and the United \nStates have strained relations and the employee may be subjected to \nretribution by the local, State, Federal, or other official government \nbody merely because of association with the U.S. Government, or the \nemployee may be pressured to divulge information contrary to U.S. \nnational interests; or\n    (D) The employee was hired at the Consulate General at Hong Kong on \nor before July 1, 1999.\n    (ii) Strong indicators of exceptional circumstances. (A) It is \nbelieved that continued service to the U.S. Government might endanger \nthe life of the employee;\n    (B) The employee has fulfilled responsibilities or given service in \na manner that approaches the heroic;\n    (C) The employee has been awarded a global or a regional ``Foreign \nService National of the Year'' Award;\n    (D) The employee has disclosed waste, fraud or abuse, a substantial \nand specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, \nrule, or regulation within the Department or other U.S. Government \nagency, if such disclosure results in significant action by the \nDepartment or other U.S. Government agency against an offending party, \nsuch as termination or severance of a contractual relationship, or \ncriminal charges against any person or entity.\n    (E) The employee has served the U.S. Government for a period of \ntwenty years or more.\n    (8) Exceptional circumstances for surviving spouses and children. \nFor classification as a special immigrant under INA 101(a)(27)(D)(ii), \nthe principal officer must determine that the deceased employee:\n    (i) Was killed in the line of duty; or\n    (ii) Performed faithful service to the United States Government \nabroad for a total of not less than 15 years; and\n    (A) Was employed by the U.S. Government as of the date of their \ndeath or in the immediately preceding period as defined in paragraph \n(c)(9) of this section, or\n    (B) Was an honorably retired former employee who, prior to their \ndeath, demonstrated at least one form of ``exceptional circumstances'' \nas defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.\n    (9) Immediately preceding period. (i) As provided in paragraph \n(c)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, a deceased employee is considered to \nhave been employed by the U.S. Government in the period immediately \npreceding their death if such employment ceased due to circumstances \nthat resulted in their death.\n    (ii) A deceased employee is presumed to not meet the criteria in \nparagraph (c)(8)(ii)(A) of this section if the employee's death \noccurred more than five years following cessation of employment. This \npresumption can be rebutted if the applicant establishes, to the \nsatisfaction of the principal officer, that the employment ceased due \nto circumstances that resulted in the employee's death, and the \nSecretary or appropriate designee finds it in the national interest to \ngrant such status. The principal officer has the primary responsibility \nfor determining whether the applicant meets this criterion, taking into \nconsideration as informed by the circumstances of the cessation of \nemployment, the cause of the employee's death as documented by the \napplicant, and other relevant evidence the applicant presents that \ndemonstrates that the cessation of employment was for reasons that \nultimately resulted in the employee's death.\n    (10) Immediate intent to immigrate. (i) The recommendation of the \nprincipal officer must certify that the applicant being recommended is \nprepared to file a petition within one year of the Department's \nnotification to the post of approval of special immigrant status, and \nto pursue an immigrant visa application within six months of the \nSecretary of State's approval of the petition or of an immigrant visa \nbecoming available, whichever is later.\n\n[[Page 99081]]\n\nIf the applicant is an employee who is not yet honorably retired, the \nrecommendation must also certify that the employee intends permanent \nseparation from U.S. Government employment abroad no later than the \ndate of departure for the United States following issuance of an \nimmigrant visa.\n    (ii) Employees of Hong Kong Consulate General hired on or before \nJuly 1, 1999, are not required to establish immediate intent to \nimmigrate. Employees of the Hong Kong Consulate General who received or \nwere approved for special immigrant status before July 1, 1999, also \nmay continue employment with the U.S. Government.\n\nJulie M. Stufft,\nDeputy Assistant Secretary, Consular Affairs, Department of State.\n[FR Doc. 2024-28846 Filed 12-9-24; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4710-06-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>",

    "supplementary_information": "The Department of State's Directorate of \nDefense Trade Controls (DDTC) administers the ITAR (22 CFR parts 120 \nthrough 130) to, among other things, regulate the export, reexport, \nretransfer, and temporary import of defense articles and defense \nservices described on the USML at ITAR Sec.  121.1. Items not subject \nto the ITAR or to the exclusive licensing jurisdiction of any other \ndepartment or agency of the U.S. Government are subject to the Export \nAdministration Regulations (EAR; 15 CFR parts 730 through 774), which \ninclude the Commerce Control List (CCL) in Supplement No. 1 to part \n774. The EAR is administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security \n(BIS), U.S. Department of Commerce. This rule does not modify the list \nof defense articles and defense services controlled for purposes of \npermanent import by the Attorney General, as enumerated on the U.S. \nMunitions Import List (USMIL) at 27 CFR 447.21.\n    Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA; 22 U.S.C. 2778), \nthe authority from which the ITAR is derived, requires periodic review \nto determine what articles and services, if any, no longer warrant \ndesignation on the USML at ITAR Sec.  121.1. In maintaining the USML, \nDDTC's Office of Defense Trade Controls Policy (DTCP) identifies \narticles and services for review for addition to or removal from the \nUSML, or for clarification on how they are described on the USML, \nthrough a variety of methods, including public feedback and interagency \nconsultations, commodity jurisdiction reviews, advisory opinions, and \ntechnology monitoring. The Department maintains the USML such that it \ncomprises those defense articles or defense services that provide a \ncritical military or intelligence advantage or, in the case of weapons, \nhave an inherently military function. The Department, informed by \nconsultations with its interagency partners, determined that the \nadditional items this rule designates on the USML warrant ITAR control \nand those articles it removes from the USML no longer do. This rule \nalso amends certain language that describes items on the USML to \nprovide additional clarity to the regulatory text. Although it is not \nseeking public comment in this final rule, the Department nonetheless \nwelcomes submissions from members of the public identifying specific \ndescriptions of items that, in their view, the Department should \nconsider revising, removing, or adding to the USML in future \nrulemaking. As members of the public are often\n\n[[Page 41779]]\n\nuniquely positioned to provide information that can assist the \nDepartment in its review of the USML, including technology \ndevelopments, commercial use of defense technology, and industry \ninterpretation and application of particular terminology, the \nDepartment accepts the submission of such views to help inform its \nmonitoring of the technology frontier via <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c78383938497b2a5abaea484a8aaaaa2a9b3b487b4b3a6b3a2e9a0a8b1\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"e6a2a2b2a5b693848a8f85a5898b8b83889295a69592879283c8818990\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n    On January 17, 2025, the Department published an interim final rule \n(the IFR) in the Federal Register at 90 FR 5594 amending the ITAR to \nremove from the USML items that no longer warrant inclusion, add to the \nUSML items that warrant inclusion, and clarify certain entries. That \nrule included a request for comments on the revisions therein and was \nscheduled to go into effect on September 15, 2025. Having reviewed and \nconsidered the comments submitted in response to the IFR, and having \nseparately considered other changes to the USML based on its ongoing \nassessments and periodic review of the USML, the Department is \npublishing this final rule, which revises the ITAR and the IFR.\n    In summary, in response to feedback the Department received from \nthe IFR, and based on other assessments and the discretion afforded it, \nthe Department is making some alterations to the changes implemented \ntherein and making certain additional changes to the ITAR with \nexplanations provided in the section of this preamble titled \n``Responses to Comments Received.'' Those changes include removing \nlead-free birdshot, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) anti-\nspoofing and GNSS anti-jam systems, and certain anti-jam antennas from \nthe USML. They also include adding a new exemption for some of the \nunderwater vessels the IFR added to USML Category XX(a)(10) that, \nalthough they provide a critical military or intelligence advantage \nsuch that they warrant description on the USML, the Department assesses \nare also highly suitable for scientific research and specific \ncommercial operations.\n\nRegulatory Implementation\n\n    The Department is, with this final rule, superseding and replacing \nthe amendments to Sec.  121.1 that were scheduled to be made on \nSeptember 15, 2025 by the IFR. For administrative purposes and to \nconform to procedures of the Office of the Federal Register (OFR), the \ndesired replacements made by this rule are procedurally accomplished by \nwithdrawing the IFR's amendatory instructions for Sec.  121.1 (i.e., \nthe IFR's amendatory instruction number three) in the preceding \n``Date'' section heading of this rule, and having the amendatory \ninstructions for Sec.  121.1 made by this rule (i.e., this final rule's \namendatory instruction number three) take effect on the same date, \nSeptember 15, 2025. Because the changes to the list of definitions in \nthe updated Sec.  121.0 are implemented by providing new regulatory \nlanguage in amendatory instruction number two, in both the IFR and this \nfinal rule, and both sets of regulatory language are scheduled to take \neffect on the same effective date, the corresponding revisions made by \nthis final rule will take effect on September 15, 2025. More \nspecifically, OFR will implement both revision instructions on the \neffective date in the order in which they were originally published in \nthe Federal Register. Thus, the amendatory instructions in this final \nrule reflect all relevant amendatory instructions from both this final \nrule and the IFR that will be implemented on the September 15, 2025 \neffective date. In summary, all of this is done so that the reader does \nnot have to combine two separate sets of sequential amendments and \ninstead can more easily view the changes made in one place and in one \nrule.\n\nResponses to Comments Received\n\n22 CFR 121.0\n\n    In response to the IFR, one commenter raised concerns that having \nan Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar is insufficient to \ndistinguish an advanced aircraft from other less sensitive military \naircraft within the definition of ``foreign advanced military \naircraft'' in Sec.  121.0. The Department notes both the IFR and this \nfinal rule specify that having an AESA fire control radar is an \nadvanced military capability meeting the definition's criteria. \nAircraft that only have AESA radar not associated with a fire control \nsystem do not meet the AESA fire control radar criterion in this \ndefinition. Additionally, in response to informal feedback, the \nDepartment is amending the definition's criteria to clarify that \n``integrated'' applies to both ``electronic warfare (EW) systems'' and \n``signature management'' systems. Integrated signature management is \nincluded in the overall design of the aircraft, while integrated EW \nsystems do not include federated (i.e., standalone) EW systems. The \nDepartment is also reformatting the foreign advanced military aircraft \ndefinition for clarity and ease of use and adding the definite article \n``the'' to certain definitions for clarity.\n\nUSML Category II\n\n    A portion of the IFR's amendatory instruction that this rule \nwithdraws was included in the IFR to correct a typographical error in \nNote 2 to paragraph (d) of Category II. As that error has since been \ncorrected through separate administrative action, State is not \nreissuing that portion of the amendatory instruction in this rule.\n\nUSML Category III\n\n    Separate from the IFR, the Department is taking this opportunity to \nrevise paragraph (d)(6) of USML Category III to exclude common lead-\nfree birdshot ammunition, even if it is made from tungsten or steel and \nthus has a core produced from tungsten or steel. The Department does so \nconsistent with its assessment that such projectiles do not provide a \ncritical military or intelligence advantage and do not have an \ninherently military function. The Department of Commerce's Export \nAdministration Regulations classify such ammunition as EAR99. \nConsistent with the Department's assertion of the military or foreign \naffairs function exception to the notice-and-comment requirements of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (see the ``Regulatory Analyses'' \nsection of this preamble), the Department did not publish a rule \nproposing this change but still welcomes relevant views at \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9cd8d8c8dfcce9fef0f5ffdff3f1f1f9f2e8efdcefe8fde8f9b2fbf3ea\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f5b1b1a1b6a58097999c96b69a9898909b8186b58681948190db929a83\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n\nUSML Category IV\n\n    One commenter observed that the Department's addition of a separate \nparagraph (c)(2) in USML Category IV implies improvised explosive \ndevices (IEDs) are not described in paragraph (a) or (b). As the \ncommenter notes, IEDs may be produced from articles described on the \nUSML or articles not described on the USML. Consequently, some IEDs \ncontain defense articles and some do not. The Department affirms that \nIEDs are not described on the USML solely because they are IEDs. \nDefense articles used as IED components remain defense articles subject \nto ITAR Sec.  120.11(c).\n    The same commenter suggested the Department add IEDs to paragraph \n(a)(9), which currently describes mines. The Department declines to \nenumerate IEDs here, or elsewhere on the USML, for the same reasons \nthey are not described in paragraph (a)(6), which describes bombs. \nAlthough some efforts to regulate the export of common IED precursor \nmaterials to high-risk areas have been temporarily implemented by other \nagencies in the past, by definition, IEDs are improvised from available\n\n[[Page 41780]]\n\nmaterials and the manufacture, production, and use of IEDs is regulated \nvia other legal authorities, including title 18 of the U.S. Code (see, \ne.g., 18 U.S.C. 842, 2332, and 2339). The same commenter suggested that \nparagraph ML4.a. of the 2024 Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List \n(WAML) explicitly controls ``explosive devices,'' including IEDs. \nHowever, the Department notes the explosive devices described in that \nparagraph are any of the following that are ``specially designed for \nmilitary use'': ``Bombs, torpedoes, grenades, smoke canisters, rockets, \nmines, missiles, depth charges, demolition-charges, demolition-devices, \ndemolition-kits, `pyrotechnic' devices, cartridges, submunitions \ntherefor and simulators.''\n    Additionally, the commenter recommended the Department not describe \nIED and mine disposal and protection equipment on the USML. To this \nend, the commenter recommended adding a note to paragraph (c) to state \nthat remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and disruptors specially \ndesigned or modified for the disposal of IEDs, and specially designed \ncomponents and accessories therefor, are subject to the EAR under \nExport Control Classification Number (ECCN) 1A006 on the CCL. The \nDepartment affirms that some ROVs and disruptors for IEDs are not \ndescribed in the new paragraph (c)(1) or (2) created by the IFR. For \nexample, an IED disruptor that disables IEDs by use of a water lance \n(i.e., a high-velocity water stream that can rapidly disrupt or damage \nthe target electronics) is not specially designed for the handling, \ncontrol, activation, monitoring, detection, protection, discharge, or \ndetonation of IEDs. As these items are not currently described in \nparagraph (c), the Department declines to add language removing them.\n\nUSML Category V\n\n    The Department is updating paragraph (c)(2) of USML Category V to \nadd a second Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Number for \npentaborane, consistent with those provided on the WAML. The Department \nnotes CAS numbers indicated on the USML may not cover all substances \nand mixtures described in the associated USML entries. As explained in \nNote 2 to Category V, CAS numbers are only provided as examples.\n\nUSML Category VIII\n\n    One commenter stated the inclusion of the AESA fire control radar \ncriterion in the definition of foreign advanced military aircraft will \nresult in the ``inadvertent inclusion of thousands of minor parts and \ncomponents'' in USML Category VIII(h)(1) that the commenter believes \nshould remain on the CCL. The Department assesses the scenario \ndescribed is a misinterpretation of the changes to paragraph (h)(1), as \nthat paragraph does not include a catch-all control for parts used \nexclusively in foreign advanced military aircraft. Instead, by adding \nparagraph (h)(1)(iii), the Department is reinforcing the existing \ncatch-all control for aircraft described in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) and \n(ii). This supports U.S. industry participation in foreign advanced \nmilitary aircraft programs by ensuring the reuse of current paragraph \n(h)(1) parts does not release those parts from the USML, which helps \nenable more favorable licensing adjudications for such repurposing of \nexisting U.S. parts.\n    In alignment with the President's announcement, on March 22, 2025, \nthat the U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance Platform has \nbeen designated as the F-47, the Department is adding the F-47 to the \nlist of aircraft in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of USML Category VIII. While \nthe F-47 is currently enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2) and (f) of USML \nCategory VIII, the catch-all control for its specially designed parts, \ncomponents, accessories, and attachments is currently in paragraph (f), \nbased on the aircraft's developmental status. Adding the F-47 to the \nlist of aircraft in (h)(1)(i) ensures those items remain described on \nthe USML after the F-47 enters production. The F-47 will be the most \nadvanced, lethal, and adaptable fighter aircraft ever developed, and \nthe Department assesses the specially designed items this change adds \nto paragraph (h)(1) will continue to provide a critical military or \nintelligence advantage after the F-47 enters production.\n    Additionally, the Department is clarifying that, while it \nconsidered removing articles specially designed for parts, components, \naccessories, and attachments used exclusively in U.S. Government \ntechnology demonstrators from paragraph (h)(29) in the IFR, it elects \nnot to do so at this time. The Department is also removing an \nextraneous use of the word ``this'' from paragraph (h)(29).\n    Furthermore, consistent with the regulatory text presented in the \nIFR, the Department notes it expanded paragraph (h)(29) in the IFR to \nalso describe articles specially designed for foreign advanced military \naircraft described in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) or developmental \naircraft described in paragraph (f). This expansion does not extend to \narticles specially designed only for parts, components, accessories, \nand attachments not described in paragraph (h)(1). For example, a scale \ntest model of a complete foreign advanced military aircraft described \nin paragraph (a)(2) is described in paragraph (h)(29)(i); however, a \nscale test model of a component of that aircraft is not described in \nparagraph (h)(29)(i). Similarly, a full-scale iron bird rig specially \ndesigned for a foreign advanced military aircraft described in \nparagraph (a)(2) is described in paragraph (h)(29)(ii); however, a part \nused exclusively in a foreign advanced military aircraft is not \ndescribed in paragraph (h)(1), and a jig specially designed for that \npart is not described in paragraph (h)(29)(iii).\n\nUSML Category XI\n\n    Separate from the IFR, the Department assesses the broad \ndescription of counter-jamming equipment in USML Category XI(a)(4)(iii) \nmay impede the Department's intent to improve civil navigation \nresiliency when it removed certain Controlled Reception Pattern \nAntennas (CRPAs) from paragraph (c)(10) in the IFR. To address this, \nthe Department is modifying paragraph (a)(4)(iii) to exclude Global \nNavigation Satellite System (GNSS) anti-jam and GNSS anti-spoofing \nsystems from that entry. Meanwhile, USML Category XII(d)(3) already \ndescribes certain GNSS anti-jam systems that continue to provide a \ncritical military or intelligence advantage. To improve the clarity of \nparagraph (a)(4)(iii), the Department is also restructuring it by \nsplitting its two clauses into subparagraphs (A) and (B), moving the \nparenthetical list of examples into a note, and adding a hyphen to \n``counter-jamming.''\n    One commenter additionally noted that, unlike paragraphs (c)(10)(i) \nand (ii) in the IFR, paragraph (c)(10)(iv) does not exclude CRPAs that \nmay be used for civil navigation resiliency by identifying the angle of \narrival of a valid or spoofed GNSS signal. The Department agrees and is \nthus excluding specific CRPAs from this entry and adding a new entry, \nparagraph (c)(10)(vii), to continue to describe CRPAs specially \ndesigned for functions other than Position, Navigation, and Timing \n(PNT) that meet the technical parameters of the former paragraph \n(c)(10)(iv). Additionally, the Department is relocating the content of \nthe note to paragraph (c)(10) into the introductory text of that \nparagraph and is updating it to reference the appropriate versions of \nFAA Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and Airborne Collision \nAvoidance System (ACAS) regulations, as the previous references are \noutdated. In response to a separate query, the Department further\n\n[[Page 41781]]\n\nnotes that paragraph (c)(10)(iv) was not intended to describe antennas \ndeveloped exclusively for civil airborne weather radar. Views on \nspecific examples of why certain antennas developed for this purpose \nmay currently be described therein are requested via email to \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d69292829586a3b4babfb595b9bbbbb3b8a2a596a5a2b7a2b3f8b1b9a0\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"2f6b6b7b6c7f5a4d43464c6c4042424a415b5c6f5c5b4e5b4a01484059\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and may be used to inform future \nrulemakings.\n    Another commenter recommended removing USML Category IX(a)(9) \nbecause radar target generators are also described in USML Category \nXI(a)(3)(xxviii). The Department declines to do so, since USML Category \nXI(a)(3)(xxviii) describes a subset of radar target generators that are \ndesignated as Significant Military Equipment (SME). That SME \nclassification takes precedence in the order of review over the non-SME \ndescription in USML Category IX(a)(9) of other radar target generators.\n\nUSML Category XIII\n\n    The Department is correcting an inadvertent omission of \n[rho]<INF>RHA</INF> in USML Category XIII(m)(9) as published in the \nIFR, deleting an unnecessary comma in the definition of \n[rho]<INF>RHA</INF>, restoring the unit designations for P<INF>o</INF>, \nP<INF>r</INF>, and AD<INF>TARGET</INF>, and adding a unit designation \nfor AD<INF>RHA</INF>. Although the IFR included amendatory instructions \nmodifying paragraph (d), upon further examination, the Department finds \nit unnecessary to amend that paragraph or its associated notes at this \ntime and is withdrawing the amendatory instructions in the IFR for \nCategory XIII(d) via this rule, by not including them in this final \nrule's amendatory instructions.\n    The Department is updating paragraph (j)(3)(iv) for consistent \nlanguage, with no change in the scope of control.\n\nUSML Category XVIII\n\n    The Department is correcting an administrative oversight in the \nUSML where, despite being empty, paragraphs (h) through (w) were not \nmarked reserved.\n\nUSML Category XX\n\n    To improve its clarity and readability, the Department is amending \nNote 1 to USML Category XX(a)(8) to remove the reference to parts, \ncomponents, accessories, attachments, and associated equipment, noting \nthat paragraph (a)(8) does not currently describe any of those \ncommodity types. Existing USML Category XX(c) describes those commodity \ntypes when specially designed for vessels described in paragraph \n(a)(8).\n    One commenter stated new paragraphs (a)(9) and (10) describe \nvessels in commercial use, including those used in surveys of subsea \nfloors for applications such as drilling, laying subsea cables, and \nmarine wind farm installations. The commenter did not identify the \nspecific vessels of concern and therefore the Department was unable to \nconfirm whether any vessels used for such applications include anti-\nrecovery features such as scuttle or self-destruct capabilities, which \nthe Department assesses provide a critical military or intelligence \nadvantage by mitigating the risk of counter-surveillance and \nexploitation of the vessels and serves no compelling commercial \npurpose. The Department also assessed that most of the underwater \nvessels referenced by the commenter are designed to be remotely \noperated and thus do not meet the threshold in paragraph (a)(10) \nconcerning operation without human interaction for longer than 24 hours \nor more than 70 nautical miles. The commenter also stated usage of \nthese vessels for commercial applications will also be regulated by the \nDepartment of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). The \nDepartment notes this is incorrect, as items described on the USML are \nnot subject to BIS's Export Administration Regulations unless \nspecifically provided for in the ITAR (e.g., see the note to paragraph \n(d) in USML Category XIX).\n    Three other commenters identified vessels, including some models of \nKongsberg Discovery's HUGIN UUVs, that would be described on the USML \nunder the new paragraph (a)(10) and are used in civil applications such \nas oceanographic research or the oil and gas industry. The Department \nhas reviewed these vessels and concluded that though some of them are \nor may be used for civil purposes, those described by paragraph (a)(10) \nnevertheless provide a critical military or intelligence advantage and \nthus it declines to remove or update paragraph (a)(10). The weight-\nbased control concisely and accurately describes the UUVs that provide \na critical military or intelligence advantage. The size threshold of \n3,000 pounds is based on an estimated technology development trajectory \nand represents the minimum size for a UUV that would enable significant \nweaponization. This considers both integrated weapons as payloads \n(e.g., torpedoes) and non-integrated weapons as cargo (e.g., naval \nmines). The Department's intent is to control large UUVs usable for \noceanographic research or commercial purposes that could be easily \nused, post-sale, as an effective weapon, or as a weapons delivery or \nIntelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform. The 24-\nhour threshold for operation without human interaction represents the \ntypical perishability of information used to task unmanned systems for \nmilitary or intelligence purposes, and it has the effect of excluding \nmany civilian remotely operated vehicles. Systems capable of operating \nwithout human interaction for 24 hours must possess the capability of \nassessing changes in environment, mission context, and self-health and \nadapting to such changes. The alternative threshold of 70 nautical \nmiles represents the distance a vessel could travel in 24 hours at an \naverage speed of approximately three knots.\n    For conciseness and clarity, the Department is also making several \nrevisions to the changes to USML Category XX(a) that the IFR made, that \nare set to take effect on September 15, 2025. First, the Department is \nremoving the parentheticals ``(and vehicles)'' from paragraphs (a)(9) \nand (10) as unnecessary. References to underwater ``vessels'' in \nCategory XX include underwater ``vehicles.'' Second, the Department is \ndeleting note 1 to paragraph (a)(10) and relocating the definition of \n``gross weight rating'' into the list of definitions in Sec.  121.0. \nThird, the Department is revising paragraph (b)(2) for greater clarity, \nwith no change to the scope of control.\n\nNew License Exemption for Certain Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicles \n(UUVs)\n\n    In the IFR, the Department included weight and performance criteria \nin the new USML Category XX(a)(10) paragraph to avoid control of \nsystems it assessed are best suited for scientific research or \ncommercial applications. In response to the IFR, one commenter proposed \nthe Department ensure its regulation of large UUVs only captures \nconduct related to military operations. The Department considered this \nrequest, along with the technological and economic landscape for these \nvessels and their availability in assessing ways to facilitate U.S. \nparticipation and collaboration for civilian tasks such as natural \nresource exploration, infrastructure inspection, and oceanographic \nresearch while continuing to mitigate the risks of their misuse, \ndiversion, and proliferation.\n    Following research based on this comment, the Department identified \nthere are U.S. companies that provide services using such vessels, as \nopposed to selling the vessels. DDTC already\n\n[[Page 41782]]\n\nreviews license applications for contractor-owned contractor-operated \n(COCO) services for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \n(ISR) and airborne mineral surveys using defense articles and would \nalso review COCO licenses for large defense article UUVs.\n    Further, in response to feedback from this commenter and the \ncommenters described in the section on USML Category XX, and the \nDepartment's subsequent assessments, the Department is creating a new \nlicense exemption for a subset of the UUVs described in USML Category \nXX(a)(10) that, although they provide a critical military or \nintelligence advantage such that they warrant description on the USML, \nthe Department assesses they are also highly suitable for scientific \nresearch and specific commercial operations.\n    This new exemption will authorize the temporary export, reexport, \nand temporary import of UUVs described in USML Category XX(a)(10) that \nmeet the exemption's size restriction of 8,000 pounds, as well as the \nprovision of defense services in the maintenance, repair, operation, or \nuse of those exempted UUVs, when the controlled activities involve one \nof the exemption's described civil uses. It will also authorize a \nsimilar scope of brokering activities. However, this exemption will not \nbe available if the activities entail the transfer of the vessel's \nregistration, control, or ownership to a foreign person.\n    While the Department is implementing that license exemption in a \nnew Sec.  126.9(u) in this final rule, it still welcomes relevant views \non this new exemption, including recommended improvements. Comments are \nrequested via email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3d7979697e6d485f51545e7e5250505853494e7d4e495c4958135a524b\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"0b4f4f5f485b7e69676268486466666e657f784b787f6a7f6e256c647d\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, and may be used to \ninform future rulemakings.\n\nEffective Date and Updating of Licenses and Agreements\n\n    The Department is implementing an effective date for this rule of \nSeptember 15, 2025, the same implementation date announced in the IFR, \nin making the revisions described in this final rule. One commenter \nrequested the Department accelerate the effective date of the rule to \nMarch 20, 2025. The Department declines to advance or postpone the \neffective date of the rule, having assessed the current effective date \nprovides necessary and sufficient time for the regulated community to \nmake necessary preparation to implement these changes.\n\nTimeline for Applications, Amendments, and Grandfathering\n\nItems Transitioning Jurisdiction From the ITAR to the EAR\n\n    Items removed from a USML paragraph by this rule may still be \ndescribed in other USML paragraphs or may become subject to the export \nlicensing jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce pursuant to the \nEAR. Before determining license requirements, it is important to \nconfirm which U.S. Government department or agency has jurisdiction \nover the items that you are planning to transfer, or broker. In \ndetermining licensing jurisdiction, exporters should evaluate the \ncontrol status of their item using the order of review found at ITAR \nSec.  120.11 and may submit a commodity jurisdiction request to DDTC \nfor assistance, if the licensing jurisdiction or USML classification is \nin doubt. If it is determined that the item is subject to the EAR, \nexporters should evaluate the CCL classification of their item using \nthe order of review in supplement no. 4 to part 774 of the EAR and may \nsubmit a commodity classification request (CCATS) to BIS for \nassistance, if the CCL classification is in doubt. Neither the BIS \nclassification nor the CCATS number may be relied upon or cited as \nevidence that the U.S. Government determined that the items described \nin the commodity classification determination are subject to the EAR \n(See 15 CFR 734.3). Licensing requirements under the EAR are determined \nby the reasons for control applicable to the item, the destination, the \nend use, and the end user. General Order No. 5 in supplement no. 1 to \npart 736 of the EAR describes the transition process for items moving \nfrom the USML to the CCL upon the publication of the pertinent final \nrules. The general order describes the grandfathering of DDTC licenses \nand agreements, the use of BIS authorizations, and the submission of \ndisclosures to BIS and DDTC related to the transition of items from the \nUSML to the CCL.\n    For those wishing to export under the authority of the EAR as soon \nas possible for items moving from the USML to the CCL, applicants may \nsubmit license applications immediately after the publication of the \nBIS final rule adding such items to the CCL or, in the case of items \nremoved from the USML by this final rule, immediately upon its \npublication. Thus, applicants may, in effect, pre-position license \napplications early to facilitate processing of the license application. \nSuch a pre-positioned license application will be processed in \naccordance with Sec.  750.4 of the EAR, but if BIS completes processing \nthe application prior to the effective date of the applicable final \nrule removing the item from the USML, BIS will hold the application \nwithout action (HWA), until the effective date of that final rule. \nApplications for transitioned items received after the effective date \nof the final rule removing them from the USML will be processed as \ndescribed in Sec.  750.4 of the EAR.\n    Existing holders of DDTC licenses, agreements, or other approvals, \nmay maintain existing authorizations or obtain new authorizations for \nitems moving from the USML to the CCL.\n\nAcceptance of Licenses\n\n    During the transition period, license applications will be accepted \nby both DDTC and BIS for items moving from the USML to the CCL. BIS \nwill not issue approved licenses for such items until on or after the \neffective date of this rule.\n    DSP-5 Licenses: Licenses for items transitioning to the CCL that \nare issued prior to the effective date of the final rule and do not \ninclude items remaining on the USML will remain valid until expired, \nreturned by the license holder, or for a period of three years from the \neffective date of the final rule, whichever occurs first, unless \notherwise revoked, suspended, or terminated. Licenses containing both \ntransitioning and non-transitioning items (mixed authorizations) will \nremain valid until expired or returned by the license holder, unless \notherwise revoked, suspended, or terminated. Any limitation, proviso, \nor other requirement required by the DDTC authorization remains in \neffect if the DDTC authorization is relied upon for export, re-export, \nor re-transfer. License amendment requests received by DDTC prior to \nthe effective date of the rule will be adjudicated on a case-by-case \nbasis up until the effective date of the rule.\n    DSP-61 and DSP-73 Licenses: All temporary licenses that are issued \nin the period prior to the effective date of the rule will remain valid \nuntil expired or returned by the license holder, unless otherwise \nrevoked, suspended, or terminated. Any limitation, proviso, or other \nrequirement imposed on the DDTC authorization will remain in effect if \nthe DDTC authorization is relied upon for export. License amendment \nrequests received by DDTC before the effective date of the rule will be \nadjudicated on a case-by-case basis until the effective date of the \nrule. All license applications, including amendments, received after \nthe effective date for items that are transitioning to the CCL that are \nnot identified in the application using an (x) paragraph will be \nReturned\n\n[[Page 41783]]\n\nWithout Action (RWA) with instructions to contact the Department of \nCommerce.\n    Technical Assistance Agreements, Manufacturing License Agreements, \nDistribution Agreements, and Related Reporting Requirements: Agreements \nand amendments containing both USML and CCL items will be adjudicated \nup to the effective date of the final rule. Agreements containing \ntransitioning and non-transitioning items that are issued prior to the \neffective date of the final rule will remain valid until expired, \nunless they require an amendment, or for a period of three years from \nthe effective date of the final rule, whichever occurs first, unless \notherwise revoked, suspended, or terminated. In order for an agreement \nto remain valid beyond three years, an amendment must be submitted to \nauthorize the CCL items using the new (x) paragraph from the relevant \nUSML category. Any activity conducted under an agreement will remain \nsubject to all limitations, provisos, and other requirements stipulated \nin the agreement.\n    Agreements containing solely transitioning items issued prior to \nthe effective date of the final rule will remain valid for a period of \nthree years from the effective date of the rule, unless revoked, \nsuspended, or terminated. After the three-year period ends, any ongoing \nactivity must be conducted under the appropriate Department of Commerce \nauthorization. Agreements and agreement amendments solely for items \nmoving to the CCL which are received after the effective date of the \nrule will be Returned Without Action (RWA) with instructions to contact \nthe Department of Commerce.\n    All reporting requirements for Manufacturing License Agreements and \nDistribution Agreements must be complied with and such reports must be \nsubmitted to the Department of State while the agreement is relied upon \nas an export authorization by the exporter.\n\nReexport/Retransfer of USML Items That Have Transitioned to the CCL\n\n    Foreign persons or U.S. persons abroad that have USML items in \ntheir inventory at the effective date of transition should review both \nthe USML and the CCL to determine the proper export jurisdiction of \nthose items. If the item is controlled by the Department of Commerce, \nany reexport or retransfer must comply with the requirements of the \nEAR. If doubt exists on the jurisdiction of the items, the foreign \nperson should contact the original exporter or manufacturer. In \ninstances when those parties are unavailable, the foreign person should \nreview the DDTC or BIS website for guidance and support options.\n    Following the effective date of this rule, foreign persons \n(including end-users, consignees, and intermediate consignees) who \nreceive, via a Department of State authorization, an item they are \ncertain has transitioned to the CCL (e.g., confirmed in writing by \nmanufacturer or supplier), should treat the item as such and submit \nrequests for post-transition reexports or retransfers to the Department \nof Commerce, as may be required by the EAR. If reexport or retransfer \nwas previously authorized under an MLA or WDA that continues to provide \nthe export authority or any stand-alone reexport/retransfer \nauthorization received pursuant to ITAR Sec.  123.9, such \nauthorizations remain valid.\n\nItems Transitioning to the USML\n\n    For those wishing to export under the authority of the ITAR as soon \nas possible for items moving onto the USML, applicants may submit \nlicense applications as soon as this rule is published in the Federal \nRegister.\n\nSubmission of Voluntary Disclosures or Voluntary Self-Disclosures\n\n    In reviewing the clarifications provided by this rule, if you \nidentify a potential violation of the ITAR, you are encouraged to \nsubmit a voluntary disclosure to DDTC, consistent with the procedures \noutlined in ITAR Sec.  127.12. For potential violations of the EAR, \npersons are encouraged to submit voluntary self-disclosures to BIS, \nconsistent with the procedures outlined in EAR Sec. Sec.  764.4 and \n764.5. For potential violations of both the EAR and the ITAR, persons \nare encouraged to submit disclosures to both agencies.\n\nRegulatory Analysis and Notices\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rulemaking is exempt from the rulemaking requirements of \nsection 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) pursuant to \nsection 553(a)(1) as a military or foreign affairs function of the \nUnited States. Although the Department elected to publish an interim \nfinal rule prior (IFR) to this final rule, it did so without prejudice \nto its determination that controlling the export, reexport, retransfer, \nand temporary import of defense articles and defense services is a \nmilitary or foreign affairs function. Additionally, relying on the same \nAPA provision and where noted, the Department is including some changes \nin this final rule that were not presented in the IFR.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    Since this rule is exempt from the notice-and-comment rulemaking \nprovisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, it does not require analysis under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This rulemaking does not involve a mandate that will result in the \nexpenditure by state, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, \nor by the private sector of $100 million or more in any year and it \nwill not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, \nno actions are deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    This rule does not meet the criteria of 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132\n\n    This rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to \nrequire consultations or warrant the preparation of a federalism \nsummary impact statement. The regulations implementing Executive Order \n12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and \nactivities do not apply to this rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563\n\n    Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Order 13563, directs \nagencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory \nalternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory \napproaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, \nenvironmental, public health and safety effects, distributed impacts, \nand equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of \nquantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing \nrules, and of promoting flexibility. After review by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB), this rule has been deemed to be a \n``significant regulatory action.''\n    This rule was undertaken pursuant to a statutory directive to \nperiodically review the items on the USML. The Department generally \ndetermines which items warrant addition to, or removal from, the USML \nby assessing whether each provides a critical military or intelligence \nadvantage based on national security and foreign policy considerations. \nBecause the costs and benefits of changing what is controlled\n\n[[Page 41784]]\n\nfocus on the effect or utility of the item or service, rather than its \nmarket prevalence or economic value, quantitative analyses cannot be \nusefully estimated and are not available, particularly since the global \nprevalence or availability of the item or service are not known. \nMoreover, the Department does not have useful estimates or models to \npredict whether or how frequently the items added to the USML by this \nrule will be applied for export or to which countries, or for temporary \nimport and from which countries. Qualitatively, the rule was assessed \nfor costs and benefits. Because listing individual items or model \nnumbers would necessarily lead to incomplete controls when an item is \nrenamed or slightly modified, the USML contains many descriptive \ncontrols that are based on broader characteristics, including form, \nfit, function, and performance capability. To more accurately describe \nonly what the Department intends to control, and to provide companies \nand individuals with better certainty, some USML revisions made by this \nrule are aimed to improve and clarify various entries and to more \nprecisely focus controls. These revisions are also informed by \nconfidential commodity jurisdiction determination and advisory opinion \nrequests, submitted by industry. The Department takes into account \ncommon questions and strives to streamline and simplify USML entries \nbased on how it understands industry experience with certain parts of \nthe USML.\n    Finally, when a complete redundancy is identified, as USML Category \nIX(e)(2) was in the IFR, the Department is removing it so that \nexporters, brokers, and temporary importers may better rely on a single \nentry, which can help to reduce compliance costs and increase the \naccuracy of relevant metrics. The alternative to this was inaction or \ndelay. The Department could have waited to amend larger parts of the \nUSML at once or continued to gather data to evaluate the controls \naffected by this rule. These alternatives were rejected. Statutory \nrequirements, including section 38(f) of the Arms Export Control Act \n(22 U.S.C. 2778(f)), and section 1345 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, require a periodic review of \nthe USML for edits like those made by this rule. While the Department \ncontinuously reviews the entire USML, it aims to focus on particular \nUSML revisions in cycles, as it has done in implementing this rule.\n\nExecutive Order 14192\n\n    This rule is exempt from Executive Order 14192 as it is a \nregulation issued with respect to a foreign affairs or national \nsecurity function of the United States.\n\nExecutive Order 12988\n\n    The Department of State has reviewed this rulemaking in light of \nsections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate \nambiguity, minimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and \nreduce burden.\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    The Department of State has determined that this rulemaking will \nnot have tribal implications, will not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian tribal governments, and will not preempt \ntribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rulemaking does not impose or revise any information \ncollections subject to 44 U.S.C. chapter 35.\n\nSigning Authority\n\n    Deputy Secretary Christopher Landau, having reviewed and approved \nthis document, has delegated the authority to electronically sign this \ndocument for purposes of publication in the Federal Register to Senior \nOfficial Brent T. Christensen, who is performing the duties of the \nUnder Secretary for Arms Control and International Security.\n\nList of Subjects\n\n22 CFR Part 121\n\n    Arms and munitions, Classified information, Exports.\n\n22 CFR Part 126\n\n    Arms and munitions, Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Technical assistance.\n    For reasons stated in the preamble, the Department of State adopts \nthe interim rule amending 22 CFR part 121, the United States Munitions \nList, which was published at 90 FR 5594 on January 17, 2025, as final \nwith changes, and amends part 126 as follows:\n\nPART 121--THE UNITED STATES MUNITIONS LIST\n\n0\n1.

    "supplementary_information": "The Department of State's Directorate of \nDefense Trade Controls (DDTC) administers the ITAR (22 CFR parts 120 \nthrough 130) to, among other things, regulate the export, reexport, \nretransfer, and temporary import of the defense articles and defense \nservices identified on the USML at ITAR Sec.  121.1. Items not subject \nto the ITAR or to the exclusive licensing jurisdiction of any other \ndepartment or agency of the U.S. Government are subject to the Export \nAdministration Regulations (EAR, 15 CFR parts 730 through 774, which \nincludes the Commerce Control List (CCL) in Supplement No. 1 to part \n774). The EAR is administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security \n(BIS), U.S. Department of Commerce. This rule does not modify the list \nof defense articles and defense services controlled for purposes of \npermanent import by the Attorney General, as enumerated on the U.S. \nMunitions Import List (USMIL) at 27 CFR 447.21.\n    Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2778), \nthe authority from which the ITAR is derived, requires periodic review \nto determine what articles and services, if any, no longer warrant \ndesignation on the U.S. Munitions List at 22 CFR 121.1. In maintaining \nthe USML, DDTC's Office of Defense Trade Controls Policy (DTCP) \nidentifies articles and services for review through a variety of \nmethods, including informal public and interagency comment, commodity \njurisdiction reviews, advisory opinions, and technology monitoring. The \nDepartment maintains the USML such that it comprises those defense \narticles or defense services that provide a critical military or \nintelligence advantage or, in the case of firearms, have an inherently \nmilitary function. The Department, informed by consultations with its \ninteragency partners, determined that the additional defense articles \nthis rule designates on the USML warrant ITAR control and those \narticles it removes from the USML no longer do. This rule also amends \ncertain language that describes items on the USML to provide additional \nclarity to the regulatory language.\n\n22 CFR 121.0\n\n    The Department incorporates definitional language and abbreviations \ncurrently found in various notes in the USML into 22 CFR 121.0, United \nStates Munitions List descriptions and definitions. Section 121.0 is \namended to remove the structure of paragraphs (a) and (b) and to add \ndefinitions to the USML in an alphabetical list. The definition \npreviously at Sec.  121.0(b) is now listed in its alphabetical order in \nSec.  121.0. Current Sec.  121.0(a) is moved to the introductory text \nof Sec.  121.0.\n\nUSML Category II\n\n    In USML Category II, Note 2 to paragraph (a)(5) is revised to \ncorrect a typographical error.\n\nUSML Category IV\n\n    USML Category IV paragraph (c) is revised and paragraphs (c)(1) and \n(2) are added to more clearly describe the equipment controlled \ntherein, and to differentiate between equipment specially designed for \ncommodities enumerated in paragraphs (a) or (b) of Category IV under \nthe new paragraph (c)(1), and equipment specially designed for \nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs) under the new paragraph (c)(2), \nsimilar to how they are differentiated in paragraph 4.b of the \nWassenaar Arrangement Munitions List. This amendment also replaces the \nundefined term ``apparatus and devices'' with the Sec.  120.40 defined \nterm ``equipment.''\n\nUSML Category V\n\n    USML Category V paragraph (c)(2) is revised to add the CAS Registry \nNumber for pentaborane and to replace the comma after ``pentaborane'' \nwith a semicolon, in order to clarify this paragraph describes \nderivatives of carboranes, decaboranes, and pentaborane. Paragraph \n(f)(4)(x) is revised to correct the CAS Registry Number. Paragraphs \n(e)(10), (f)(19), and (g)(4) are revised to correct typographical \nerrors.\n\nUSML Category VII\n\n    Note 3 to USML Category VII is revised to further clarify the \nuniverse of ground vehicles described, with no change to the scope of \ncontrols. Specifically, the types of vehicular control and locomotion \nemployed are irrelevant when evaluating a vehicle against the control \ncriteria. The Department affirms that although some unmanned ground \nvehicles, based on their method of control or locomotion, may be \nreferred to by the public colloquially as ``robots,'' they must still \nbe evaluated against the criteria in USML Category VII.\n\nUSML Category VIII\n\n    USML Category VIII(h)(1) is revised to clarify which commodities \nare described therein by incorporating relevant portions of the \nexisting note to paragraph (h)(1). This revision also serves to \nfacilitate reference to the included list of aircraft by other USML \nparagraphs, and to better align controls with the Department's intent \naround U.S. Government technology demonstrators. Additionally, it \nprecludes release of commodities from paragraph (h)(1) based solely on \ntheir subsequent use in aircraft included in USML Category XXI \n(pursuant to the procedures therein) or in foreign advanced military \naircraft. Foreign advanced military aircraft, as newly defined in Sec.  \n121.0, include non-U.S. origin aircraft and foreign derivatives of U.S. \norigin aircraft, either in development or entering production after \n2023, with one or more of the following advanced military capabilities: \nActive Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) fire control radar, \nintegrated signature management, electronic warfare systems, or the \nability to engage targets beyond visual range (BVR). The Department \nfurther highlights the use of the term ``AESA fire control radar'' to \nensure that AESA weather radars commonly used in civil aviation are \nclearly excluded from this list of advanced military capabilities. The \nyear 2023 was chosen as the production year in this definition to \nensure alignment with the temporary modification to the USML issued on \nDecember 4, 2023 (88 FR 84072), and extended on November 26, 2024 (89 \nFR 93170), which states that parts used in or with the KF-21 continue \nto be described on the USML.\n    As practitioners have confused the F-15SE (Silent Eagle) with the \nF-15E (Strike Eagle), the F-15SE nomenclature is also clarified. \nFurther, the ``B1B'' is replaced by ``B-1.'' As the B-1A never entered \ninto production, this change does not change the export classification \nof existing items. The Department makes this change consistent with the \nmajority of aircraft listed in the paragraph and its intent to include \nfuture variants of those aircraft. The Department notes the only \naircraft listed with series letters (F-15SE, F/A-18E/F, and EA-18G) in \nthis paragraph intentionally exclude earlier variants (for example, the \ncontrol does not include the F-15A, which is an F-15 variant developed \nbefore the F-15SE).\n\n[[Page 5596]]\n\nAdditionally, the Department adds the MQ-25 and the RQ-170 to the list \nof aircraft in paragraph (h)(1)(i). The MQ-25 provides a critical \nmilitary advantage in its ability to support the future Navy carrier \nair wing and is central to the Navy's strategic Unmanned Campaign \nFramework. The RQ-170 is a high-altitude, long-endurance, low-\nobservable unmanned aerial vehicle that provides a critical military \nand intelligence advantage in its ability to perform key intelligence, \nsurveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition, and electronic \nwarfare functions. Paragraph (h)(1) describes articles used in some of \nthe most advanced U.S. military aircraft. The changes to paragraph \n(h)(1) ensure those specially designed articles are not released from \nthis entry based on their subsequent use in USML Category XXI aircraft, \nforeign advanced military aircraft, or U.S. Government (USG) technology \ndemonstrator aircraft.\n    Ensuring those elements are not released from paragraph (h)(1) \nbased on subsequent use in foreign advanced military aircraft is \nconsistent with the language of Sec.  120.3(a)(2). With this change, \nthe Department treats use of these commodities in foreign advanced \nmilitary aircraft as it has in their use in advanced U.S. military \naircraft. This addition facilitates opportunities for reuse and \ncommonality with partner aircraft by enabling U.S. content to be \nutilized in those platforms without unnecessary redesigns or unmerited \nremoval from the USML.\n    The Department further considered amending the language to remove \ncommodities designed exclusively for non-Department of Defense (DoD) \nUSG technology demonstrators from paragraph (h)(1). The Department \ndeclines to do so, as such commodities are generally not currently \ndescribed in paragraph (h)(1). Specifically, USG technology \ndemonstrators are unique among the aircraft listed in paragraph (h)(1), \nas some technology demonstrators are described on the USML, while \nothers are not. The Department notes commodities used in technology \ndemonstrators are often developed exclusively for those demonstrators \nor repurposed from other USML or CCL platforms for time and cost \nsavings; those commodities must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for \nproper export classification. Specifically, for USG technology \ndemonstrators that are themselves not described on the USML (``these \naircraft''), it is generally the case that:\n\n--Articles designed for and used only in other aircraft listed in \nparagraph (h)(1) before and during subsequent unmodified use in these \naircraft generally remain described in paragraph (h)(1), as explained \nby the following analysis:\n--In the context of paragraph (h)(1), such articles meet the criteria \nin, and thus are caught by, Sec.  120.41(a)(1) as having properties \npeculiarly responsible for the controlled characteristic (i.e., their \nuse in the listed aircraft), and (a)(2) for their use in or with the \nother listed aircraft.\n--In the context of paragraph (h)(1), such articles are not released by \nSec.  120.41(b)(3), (4), or (5), as they were originally developed for \naircraft described in either USML Category VIII or XXI, and the USG \ntechnology demonstrator does not enter production as defined in Sec.  \n120.43.\n--Articles designed for, and used in, aircraft subject to the EAR prior \nto unmodified use in these aircraft are not described in paragraph \n(h)(1) but may be described elsewhere on the USML, as explained by the \nfollowing analysis:\n--In the context of paragraph (h)(1), there are circumstances wherein \nsuch articles would be released by Sec.  120.41(b)(3), regardless of \nmeeting the criteria in Sec.  120.41(a).\n--With contemporaneous documentation, there are circumstances in which \nthe articles would also be released by paragraph (b)(4) or (5).\n--Articles designed for, and only used in, these aircraft are not \ndescribed in paragraph (h)(1), but may be described elsewhere on the \nUSML, as explained by the following analysis:\n--In the context of paragraph (h)(1), such articles meet the criteria \nin Sec.  120.41(a)(1) as having properties peculiarly responsible for \nthe controlled characteristic (i.e., their use in the listed aircraft), \nbut not (a)(2) unless they are used in or with a defense article.\n--In the context of paragraph (h)(1), such articles are not released by \nSec.  120.41(b)(3), as the USG technology demonstrator does not enter \nproduction. However, they could be released by paragraph (b)(4), as \nthey were developed with the knowledge they would be used in these \naircraft, often in a system that is subject to the EAR.\n--In contrast, articles designed for, and only used in, USG technology \ndemonstrators described on the USML are described in paragraph (h)(1), \nas explained in the following analysis:\n--In the context of paragraph (h)(1), such articles meet the criteria \nin Sec.  120.41(a)(1) as having properties peculiarly responsible for \nthe controlled characteristic (i.e., their use in the listed aircraft), \nand (a)(2) for their use in or with aircraft described in USML Category \nVIII.\n\n    In the context of paragraph (h)(1), such articles are not released \nby Sec.  120.41(b)(3), (4), or (5), as they were originally developed \nfor an aircraft described in USML Category VIII. The Department is also \namending the text of the current ``Note to paragraph (h)(1),'' \nredesignating it as ``Note 1 to paragraph to (h)(1),'' and adding \n``Note 2 to paragraph (h)(1).'' The addition of ``Note 2 to paragraph \n(h)(1)'' outlines an example of the scope of paragraph (h)(1) for \narticles used in USG technology demonstrators.\n    With these revisions to paragraph (h)(1) and the notes to paragraph \n(h)(1), the Department also terminates the temporary modification to \nCategory VIII of the USML that was issued on December 4, 2023 (88 FR \n84072) and extended on November 26, 2024 (89 FR 93170).\n    The Department notes certain commodities designed exclusively for \nDoD-funded developmental aircraft, including aircraft jointly funded by \nDoD and another agency, remain defense articles described in paragraph \n(f) of USML Category VIII.\n    Paragraph (h)(29) of USML Category VIII is revised to clarify the \ncommodities described therein include both those designed for the \naircraft listed and the defense articles described in paragraph (h)(1), \nwith a change in control via the removal of commodities specially \ndesigned for USG technology demonstrators.\n    The note located at the end of USML Category VIII is moved to \nfollow USML Category VIII paragraph (h), renamed ``Note 1 to paragraph \n(h),'' and revised for clarity, with no change in scope.\n\nUSML Category IX\n\n    USML Category IX(e)(2) is placed in reserve to eliminate \nredundancy. Technical data directly related to the software and \ndatabases enumerated in paragraph (b)(4) is already described in \nparagraph (e)(1).\n\nUSML Category X\n\n    Developmental exoskeletons have been identified as a technology \nwarranting ITAR control due to the critical military advantage they \nprovide. Thus, Category X is amended by removing paragraph (b) from \nreserve and adding a new paragraph (b) to describe exoskeletons under \ndevelopment for DoD, along with standard exclusions applied to other \ndevelopmental articles to provide advance notice to industry and to \navoid\n\n[[Page 5597]]\n\ncontrolling those that do not provide a critical military advantage.\n    The Department also amends Category X to align body armor \nprotection levels with the most recent NIJ standard, 0123.00, \n``Specification for NIJ Ballistic Protection Levels and Associated Test \nThreats.'' All references to ``NIJ Type IV'' have been updated to NIJ \nRF3. ``Note 1 to paragraph (a)(1)'' and ``Note to paragraphs (a) and \n(d)'' have also been updated to reference the new standard. ``Note to \nparagraphs (a) and (d)'' is redesignated as ``Note 1 to paragraphs (a) \nand (d).''\n\nUSML Category XI\n\n    USML Category XI paragraphs (c)(10)(i) and (ii) are revised to \nreflect that certain anti-jam antennas no longer provide a critical \nmilitary advantage, with increasing commercial utilization applicable \nto civil GPS resiliency. Following consultations with DoD, the beam \nswitching speed criterion in paragraph (c)(10)(i) is revised from 50 \nmilliseconds down to one millisecond, and the convergence time \ncriterion in paragraph (c)(10)(ii) is revised from one second down to \none millisecond, as the Department seeks to control only the most \nsensitive and effective anti-jam antennas in USML Category XI(c)(10)(i) \nand (ii). The Department further intends to exclude Controlled \nReception Pattern Antennas (CRPAs) for Position, Navigation, and Timing \n(PNT) from paragraph (c)(10). To implement this, the Department is \nremoving all CRPAs from paragraphs (c)(10)(i) and (ii) and adding \nparagraphs (c)(10)(v) and (vi) to describe the CRPAs for non-PNT \napplications that meet the updated criteria used in paragraphs \n(c)(10)(i) and (ii) the CRPA antennas were moved from. In removing \nCRPAs for PNT, the Department intends to facilitate civil global \nnavigation system resiliency. CRPAs use multiple elements and advanced \nsignal processing techniques to dynamically control their reception \npattern, thereby enhancing signal reception from desired directions and \nsuppressing interference from undesired directions. Generally, in \ncomparing CRPAs to the antennas that remain described in paragraphs \n(c)(10)(i) and (ii), CRPAs are more optimized to control the reception \npattern instead of the transmission beam steering or switching. This is \nin line with the Position, Navigation, and Timing, Advisory Board's \n(PNTAB) recommendation to remove CRPAs from the USML. The antennas \nremoved from the USML by these changes are neither subject to \nmultilateral controls nor controlled as munitions in other countries \nthat produce them. Once removed from the USML, these anti-jam antennas \nwill become subject to the EAR under the jurisdiction of the Department \nof Commerce.\n\nUSML Category XII\n\n    USML Category XII paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is revised to update the \nlanguage to reflect the current description of Positioning Service from \nPrecise Positioning Service to Protected Positioning Service (PPS). In \nthe 2021 Federal Radionavigation Plan published by the Departments of \nDefense, Transportation, and Homeland Security (available at <a href=\"https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/63024\">https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/63024</a>), PPS has been updated to \n``Protected'' Positioning Service from the former ``Precise'' \nPositioning Service. This change accurately reflects the technology's \nability to operate in degraded environments as opposed to legacy \nencryption abilities that facilitate greater position precision and no \nlonger provide a critical military advantage.\n\nUSML Category XIII\n\n    USML Category XIII paragraph (b)(4) is revised to update the name \nof the Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) to the National \nCross Domain Strategy and Management Office (NCDSMO).\n    The Department further amends Category XIII to align armor \nprotection levels with the most recent NIJ standard, 0123.00, \n``Specification for NIJ Ballistic Protection Levels and Associated Test \nThreats.'' All references to ``NIJ Level III'' are updated to NIJ RF1. \nAs the new RF1 standard corresponds to the previous Type III standard, \nthis is not a significant change in control. The reference in paragraph \n(m)(10) is also updated to reference the new standard.\n    Additionally, paragraph (e)(2) is revised for clarification and to \nadd paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii). Category XIII is further revised to \nadd specific fluids to the USML in paragraph (j)(3). Each of these \nfluids was developed for one or more critical military applications for \nwhich existing fluids were unsuitable; by including a specially \ndesigned criterion, general-purpose fluids subsequently selected for \nuse in a military application are not described by this control. \nLastly, paragraph (m)(9) is amended to clarify the definitions of \nvariables in the equation for E<INF>m</INF>.\n\nUSML Category XIV\n\n    Additional nerve agents and a defoliant are added to USML Category \nXIV in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) through (viii) and (j), and controls on \nChemical Agent Resistive Coatings (CARC) are clarified in paragraph \n(f)(7). The nerve agent additions are made pursuant to changes to \nSchedule 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention, while the defoliant \naddition is a constituent of Agent Orange, for which the Department is \nunaware of current commercial applications.\n    The clarification of CARC controls in paragraph (f)(7) is made \nconsistent with longstanding policy published on DDTC's website. As \nCARC is controlled only through the point of application and curing, \nexport applications for CARC must specify the proposed end-users and \nend-uses, and export licenses for CARC impose limitations on the same. \nOf note, the control release for CARC that has been applied and cured \nonly applies to USML Category XIV(f)(7); this release does not apply to \ncoatings or materials described elsewhere on the USML. For example, \nwhen a USML Category XIII(j)(2) coating is applied to an item subject \nto the EAR, a DDTC license or other approval continues to be required \nfor the coating, when the item to which the coating was applied is \nexported, reexported, or retransferred.\n\nUSML Category XIX\n\n    USML Category XIX paragraphs (d) and (f)(1) are amended to add \nspecific DoD-funded aircraft engines in development that provide a \ncritical military or intelligence advantage, as well as their specially \ndesigned parts, components, accessories, and attachments. Specifically, \nparagraph (d) is split into two parts, paragraphs (d)(1) and (2), and \namended to include the XT900, which is a developmental engine resulting \nfrom the enumerated HPW3000 technology demonstrator.\n    The note to paragraph (d) is redesignated as the note to paragraph \n(d)(1), to continue its applicability to the engines in former \nparagraph (d) following their movement to paragraph (d)(1), with no \nchange in scope. Paragraph (f)(1) is amended to include specially \ndesigned parts, components, accessories, and attachments for the engine \nnow described in paragraph (d)(2), and to incorporate a portion of the \nnote to paragraph (f)(1). The remainder of the note to paragraph (f)(1) \nis redesignated as ``Note 1 to paragraph (f)(1)'' and revised for \nclarity. Paragraph (f)(1) is further amended to clarify that parts, \ncomponents, accessories, and attachments are not released if common \nonly to a listed engine and an engine designated in USML Category \nXXI(a), and to add a catch-all control for XA100, XA101, XA102, XA103, \nand T901 engine hardware. The XA-series engines represent a substantial \nleap in propulsion capability. Items specially\n\n[[Page 5598]]\n\ndesigned for these engines provides a critical military or intelligence \nadvantage in enabling the engines to provide improved thrust-to-weight \ncapability while addressing fuel efficiency, affordability, and \nsustainment for warfighter operational readiness. The T901 powers the \nFuture Vertical Lift platform and provides 33% more thrust than, but \nretains the same size as, its predecessor.\n    Paragraph (f)(2) is amended to clarify the items described in \nparagraph (f)(2) by replacing a term of art (``hot section \ncomponents'') with defined regulatory terms (hot section ``parts'' and \n``components''), with no change in scope, and to add related cooled \nstructures for combustion chambers and liners. Punctuation is also \nupdated with no change in scope.\n\nUSML Category XX\n\n    USML Category XX is amended to add paragraphs (a)(9) and (10) to \ncontrol two new classes of uncrewed, untethered vessels and vehicles \nthat provide a critical military advantage: specifically, those \nequipped with anti-recovery features, and larger systems with \nsignificant range or endurance. Paragraph (a)(10) includes criteria to \navoid control of systems below certain weight and performance \nthresholds the Department assesses are best suited for scientific \nresearch or commercial applications. Tethered systems are similarly \nexcluded from both paragraphs (a)(9) and (10).\n    USML Category XX(b)(2) is revised for clarity, with no change to \nthe scope of the control.\n\nUSML Category XXI\n\n    USML Category XXI is amended to move the second sentence of \nparagraph (a) into a new note, and to further clarify the \nconsiderations when designating an article in USML Category XXI.\n\nEffective Date and Updating of Licenses and Agreements\n\n    The Department notes it previously provided a 180-day transition \nperiod between the publication of the final rule for reviews of entire \nUSML categories revised under Export Control Reform and the effective \ndate of the transition of items to updated classifications. See 78 FR \n22740, 22747 (Apr. 16, 2013). While the Department has also recently \nissued rules with shorter transition periods, the Department provides a \n240-day delayed effective date for this rule. Consistent with prior \nrevisions of USML categories, additional guidance that addresses \nspecific licensing scenarios will be provided on DDTC's website.\n\nTimeline for Applications, Amendments, and Grandfathering\n\nItems Transitioning Jurisdiction From the ITAR to the EAR\n\n    Items removed from a USML paragraph by this rule may still be \ndescribed in other USML paragraphs or may become subject to the export \nlicensing jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce pursuant to the \nEAR. Exporters should evaluate the control status of their item using \nthe orders of review in the ITAR and the EAR and may submit a commodity \njurisdiction request to DDTC for assistance or--if there is no doubt it \nis subject to the EAR--a commodity classification request to BIS. \nLicensing requirements under the EAR are determined by the reasons for \ncontrol applicable to the item, the destination, the end use, and the \nend user. General Order No. 5 in supplement no. 1 to part 736 of the \nEAR describes the transition process for items moving from the USML to \nthe CCL upon the publication of the pertinent final rules. The general \norder describes the grandfathering of DDTC licenses and agreements, the \nuse of BIS authorizations, and the submission of disclosures to BIS and \nDDTC related to the transition of items from the USML to the CCL.\n    For those wishing to export under the authority of the EAR as soon \nas possible for items moving from the USML to the CCL, applicants may \nsubmit license applications immediately after the publication of the \nBIS final rule adding such items to the CCL. Thus, applicants may, in \neffect, pre-position license applications early to facilitate \nprocessing of the license application. Such a pre-positioned license \napplication will be processed in accordance with Sec.  750.4 of the \nEAR, but if BIS completes processing the application prior to the \neffective date of the applicable final rule, BIS will hold the \napplication without action (HWA), until the effective date of that \nfinal rule. Applications for transitioned items received after the \neffective date of the final rule will be processed as described in \nSec.  750.4 of the EAR.\n    Existing holders of DDTC licenses, agreements, or other approvals, \nmay maintain existing authorizations or obtain new authorizations for \nitems moving from the USML to the CCL. Questions regarding the \ncontinued use of DDTC licenses, agreements, or other approvals should \nbe directed to DDTC.\n\nAcceptance of Licenses\n\n    During the transition period, license applications will be accepted \nby both DDTC and BIS for items moving from the USML to the CCL. BIS \nwill not issue approved licenses for such items until on or after the \neffective date of this rule.\n    DSP-5 Licenses: Licenses for items transitioning to the CCL that \nare issued prior to the effective date of the final rule and do not \ninclude items remaining on the USML will remain valid until expired, \nreturned by the license holder, or for a period of three years from the \neffective date of the final rule, whichever occurs first, unless \notherwise revoked, suspended, or terminated. Licenses containing both \ntransitioning and non-transitioning items (mixed authorizations) will \nremain valid until expired or returned by the license holder, unless \notherwise revoked, suspended, or terminated. Any limitation, proviso, \nor other requirement required by the DDTC authorization remains in \neffect if the DDTC authorization is relied upon for export, re-export, \nor re-transfer. License amendment requests received by DDTC prior to \nthe effective date of the rule will be adjudicated on a case-by-case \nbasis up until the effective date of the rule.\n    DSP-61 and DSP-73 Licenses: All temporary licenses that are issued \nin the period prior to the effective date of the rule will remain valid \nuntil expired or returned by the license holder, unless otherwise \nrevoked, suspended, or terminated. Any limitation, proviso, or other \nrequirement imposed on the DDTC authorization will remain in effect if \nthe DDTC authorization is relied upon for export. License amendment \nrequests received by DDTC before the effective date of the rule will be \nadjudicated on a case-by-case basis until the effective date of the \nrule. All license applications, including amendments, received after \nthe effective date for items that are transitioning to the CCL that are \nnot identified in an (x) paragraph entry will be Returned Without \nAction (RWA) with instructions to contact the Department of Commerce.\n    Technical Assistance Agreements, Manufacturing License Agreements, \nDistribution Agreements, and Related Reporting Requirements: Agreements \nand amendments containing both USML and CCL items will be adjudicated \nup to the effective date of the final rule. Agreements containing \ntransitioning and non-transitioning items that are issued prior to the \neffective date of the final rule will remain valid until expired, \nunless they require an amendment, or for a period of three years from \nthe effective date of the final rule, whichever occurs first, unless \notherwise revoked, suspended, or terminated. In order for an agreement \nto remain valid beyond three years, an amendment must be submitted to\n\n[[Page 5599]]\n\nauthorize the CCL items using the new (x) paragraph from the relevant \nUSML category. Any activity conducted under an agreement will remain \nsubject to all limitations, provisos, and other requirements stipulated \nin the agreement.\n    Agreements containing solely transitioning items issued prior to \nthe effective date of the final rule will remain valid for a period of \nthree years from the effective date of the rule, unless revoked, \nsuspended, or terminated. After the three-year period ends, any ongoing \nactivity must be conducted under the appropriate Department of Commerce \nauthorization. Agreements and agreement amendments solely for items \nmoving to the CCL which are received after the effective date of the \nrule will be Returned Without Action (RWA) with instructions to contact \nthe Department of Commerce.\n    All reporting requirements for Manufacturing License Agreements and \nDistribution Agreements must be complied with and such reports must be \nsubmitted to the Department of State while the agreement is relied upon \nas an export authorization by the exporter.\n    Reexport/Retransfer of USML Items That Have Transitioned to the \nCCL: Foreign persons or U.S. persons abroad that have USML items in \ntheir inventory at the effective date of transition should review both \nthe USML and the CCL to determine the proper export jurisdiction of \nthose items. If the item is controlled by the Department of Commerce, \nany reexport or retransfer must comply with the requirements of the \nEAR. If doubt exists on the jurisdiction of the items, the foreign \nperson should contact the original exporter or manufacturer. In \ninstances when those parties are unavailable, the foreign person should \nreview the DDTC or BIS website for guidance and support options.\n    Following the effective date, foreign persons (including end-users, \nconsignees, and intermediate consignees) who receive, via a Department \nof State authorization, an item they are certain has transitioned to \nthe CCL (e.g., confirmed in writing by manufacturer or supplier), \nshould treat the item as such and submit requests for post-transition \nreexports or retransfers to the Department of Commerce, as may be \nrequired by the EAR. If reexport or retransfer was previously \nauthorized under an MLA or WDA that continues to provide the export \nauthority or any stand-alone reexport/retransfer authorization received \npursuant to ITAR Sec.  123.9, such authorizations remain valid.\n\nItems Transitioning to the USML\n\n    For those wishing to export under the authority of the ITAR as soon \nas possible for items moving onto the USML, applicants may submit \nlicense applications as soon as this rule is published in the Federal \nRegister.\n\nSubmission of Voluntary Self-Disclosures\n\n    In reviewing the clarifications provided by this rule, if you \nidentify a potential violation of the ITAR, you are encouraged to \nsubmit a voluntary disclosure to DDTC, consistent with the procedures \noutlined in Sec.  127.12. For potential violations of the EAR, persons \nare encouraged to submit voluntary self-disclosures to BIS. For \npotential violations of both the EAR and the ITAR, persons are \nencouraged to submit disclosures to both agencies.\n\nRequest for Comments\n\n    Consistent with its ongoing USML review process, the Department is \nrequesting public comments on the revisions described in this \nrulemaking. The Department encourages the public to provide comments \ndirectly related to this rule and responsive to the questions described \nbelow. To facilitate timely review and assessment, comments should be \nprovided in a concise sentence or paragraph, followed by supporting \nexplanatory paragraphs and examples, with each distinct comment treated \nseparately (as opposed to multiple comments in one paragraph or \nsection). The Department requests comments focused on the following \nquestions:\n    1. How much would practitioners benefit from the Department \ndefining the term ``Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas (CRPAs)'' as \nused in USML Category XI(c)(10)? Are there criteria, other than those \ndescribed in the preamble of this rule, that may help better \ndistinguish between CRPAs described in paragraph (c)(10)(v) and \nantennas described in paragraph (c)(10)(i)?\n    2. The addition of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) to USML Category VIII \nensures that parts, components, accessories, and attachments specially \ndesigned for aircraft listed in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) and (ii) are not \nreleased from paragraph (h)(1) due to their use in foreign advanced \nmilitary aircraft described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of USML \nCategory VIII.\n    a. The Department requests comment on its consideration of adding \nto paragraph (h)(1) a new paragraph (h)(1)(iv), to retain parts used in \nparagraphs (h)(1)(i) or (ii) aircraft even when they are used in \n``aircraft described in paragraph (a)(3) of USML Category VIII,'' as \nthe Department assesses that training aircraft described in paragraph \n(a)(3) often serve as proving grounds for future paragraph (a)(1) or \n(2) aircraft.\n    b. The Department requests comment on its consideration of \nexpanding paragraph (h)(1) to add parts, components, accessories, and \nattachments specially designed for the foreign advanced military \naircraft listed in paragraph (h)(1)(iii), even if they are not utilized \nin an aircraft listed in paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (ii), commensurate with \nthe Department's regulation of similar items for the advanced U.S. \naircraft described in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) and (ii). For example, what \neffect would describing these foreign articles in paragraph (h)(1) have \non existing international defense industrial cooperation and supply \nchains?\n    3. With this rule, the Department changes paragraph (d) of USML \nCategory XIX to read ``The following engines:'' and then describes \nspecific aircraft engines in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2). The Department \nrequests comment on its consideration of changing that language to \n``The following engine series:'' in order to more completely describe \nengines that provide a critical military or intelligence advantage.\n    4. Paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of USML Category XIX describe specific \naircraft engines. The Department requests comment on its consideration \nof expanding that scope to include ``military variants'' of those \nengines, similar to its regulation of certain gas turbine engine parts \nin paragraph (f)(1)(i) of USML Category XIX for military variants of \nthe listed engines.\n    5. Are there commodities, services, or technical data closely \nrelated to these revisions that warrant ITAR control, but are currently \neither not described on the USML, or not described with sufficient \nclarity? If so, please provide examples and a concise explanation.\n    6. Are there specific commodities, services, or technical data \ndescribed on the USML following these revisions that are, or have \npreviously been, in normal commercial use, that were previously \ntransitioned to another agency's jurisdiction, or that were previously \ndetermined not to be subject to the ITAR via a Commodity Jurisdiction \ndetermination? If so, please include supporting documentation.\n    7. Are there specific commodities, services, or technical data \ndescribed on the USML following these revisions for which civil use is \nproposed, intended, or anticipated in the next five years? Please \ninclude supporting\n\n[[Page 5600]]\n\ndocumentation and a point of contact familiar with the details.\n    8. Are there specific functions, performance levels, or \ncharacteristics related to these revisions that could better:\n    a. Distinguish between the commodities that do, and do not, warrant \nITAR control;\n    b. Delineate the criteria for control, in lieu of using the term \n`specially designed'; or\n    c. Align with the constructions or language used in other USML \nentries?\n    9. Can any of these revisions be more concisely stated?\n\nComment Submissions\n\nInstructions\n\n    Include the Regulatory Information Number (RIN) (1400-AF42) for all \nsubmissions related to this rule. Parties who wish to comment \nanonymously may do so by submitting their comments via \n<a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>, leaving the fields that would identify the \ncommenter blank and including no identifying information in the comment \nitself. Commenters are cautioned not to include proprietary, export-\ncontrolled, personal, or other sensitive information in their comments \nthat they would not want to be made public. If such information would \nprovide useful insight to the comment: (1) assemble that information in \na separate document with proprietary markings; (2) include \n``Proprietary supplement on file with: [provide POC]'' as the first \nline in the body of the email submission; (3) submit the public portion \nof the comment via email; and (4) call DDTC at (202) 663-1282 to \ncoordinate submission of the proprietary supplement.\n\nRegulatory Analysis and Notices\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rulemaking is exempt from the rulemaking requirements of \nsection 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) pursuant to \nsection 553(a)(1) as a military or foreign affairs function of the \nUnited States. Although the Department has elected to publish this \ninterim final rule with a concurrent 30-day request for public comment \nand a 240-day delayed effective date, it does so without prejudice to \nits determination that controlling the export, reexport, retransfer, \nand temporary import of defense articles and defense services is a \nmilitary or foreign affairs function.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    Since this rule is exempt from the notice-and-comment rulemaking \nprovisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, it does not require analysis under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This rulemaking does not involve a mandate that will result in the \nexpenditure by state, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, \nor by the private sector of $100 million or more in any year and it \nwill not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, \nno actions are deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    This rule does not meet the criteria of 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132\n\n    This rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to \nrequire consultations or warrant the preparation of a federalism \nsummary impact statement. The regulations implementing Executive Order \n12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and \nactivities do not apply to this rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094\n\n    Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Orders 13563 and \n14094, direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available \nregulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select \nregulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential \neconomic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributed \nimpacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance \nof quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of \nharmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. After review by the \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB), this rule has been deemed a \n``significant regulatory action.'' This rule was undertaken pursuant to \na statutory directive to periodically review the items on the USML. The \nDepartment generally determines which items warrant addition to, or \nremoval from, the USML by assessing whether each provides a critical \nmilitary or intelligence advantage based on national security and \nforeign policy considerations. Because the costs and benefits of \nchanging what is controlled focus on the effect or utility of the item \nor service, rather than its market prevalence or economic value, \nquantitative analyses cannot be usefully estimated and are not \navailable, particularly since the global prevalence or availability of \nthe item or service are not known. Moreover, the Department does not \nhave useful estimates or models to predict whether or how frequently \nthe items added to the USML by this rule will be applied for export or \nto which countries, or for temporary import and from which countries. \nQualitatively, the rule was assessed for costs and benefits. Because \nlisting individual items or model numbers would necessarily lead to \nincomplete controls when an item is renamed or slightly modified, the \nUSML contains many descriptive controls that are based on broader \ncharacteristics, including form, fit, function, and performance \ncapability. To more accurately describe only what the Department \nintends to control, and to provide companies and individuals with \nbetter certainty, some USML revisions made by this rule are aimed to \nimprove and clarify various entries and to more precisely focus \ncontrols. These revisions are also informed by confidential commodity \njurisdiction determination and advisory opinion requests, submitted by \nindustry. The Department takes into account common questions and \nstrives to streamline and simplify USML entries based on how it \nunderstands industry experience with certain parts of the USML. \nFinally, when a complete redundancy is identified, as in one revision \nmade by this rule, it is removed so that exporters, brokers, and \ntemporary importers may better rely on a single entry, which can help \nto reduce compliance costs and increase the accuracy of relevant \nmetrics. One alternative to this is inaction or delay. The Department \ncould have waited to amend larger parts of the USML at once or \ncontinued to gather data to evaluate the controls affected by this \nrule. These alternatives were rejected. Statutory requirements, \nincluding section 38(f) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n2778(f)), and section 1345 of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2024, require a periodic review of the USML for edits \nlike those made by this rule. While the Department continuously reviews \nthe entire USML, it aims to focus on particular USML categories for \ntargeted revisions in cycles, as it has done in implementing this rule.\n\nExecutive Order 12988\n\n    The Department of State has reviewed this rulemaking in light of \nsections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate \nambiguity, minimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and \nreduce burden.\n\n[[Page 5601]]\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    The Department of State has determined that this rulemaking will \nnot have tribal implications, will not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian tribal governments, and will not preempt \ntribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rulemaking does not impose or revise any information \ncollections subject to 44 U.S.C. chapter 35.\n\nSigning Authority\n\n    Assistant Secretary C.S.

    "supplementary_information": "A. Background\n\n    The Department of State (``Department'') is amending its \nregulations at 22 CFR 40.21(a)(5), and 22 CFR 40.22(c) regarding the \neffect of a pardon on a visa applicant's ineligibility under section \n212(a)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(2)(A)) and INA section 212(a)(2)(B) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(B)), \nrespectively. The current regulation at 22 CFR 40.21(a)(5) provides \nthat an alien is not ineligible for a visa under INA section \n212(a)(2)(A) if a full and unconditional pardon has been granted by the \nPresident of the United States, by a governor of a state of the United \nStates, or by certain other specified officials. Similarly, the current \nregulation at 22 CFR 40.22(c) provides that an alien is not ineligible \nfor a visa under INA section 212(a)(2)(B) based on having been \nconvicted of two or more offenses, if a full and unconditional pardon \nhas been granted by the President of the United States, by a governor \nof a state of the United States, or by certain other specified \nofficials. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently examined the \nregulation at 22 CFR 40.21(a)(5), finding that it conflicts with INA's \nprovisions in section 212(a)(2)(A)(i) governing inadmissibility based \non conviction or admission of certain crimes, which do not include an \nexception or waiver to that inadmissibility for applicants who receive \na pardon.\n\n. . . the [INA] is clear that a pardon does not make an otherwise \ninadmissible noncitizen admissible, even if a pardon can save a \nresident noncitizen from being removed . . . and where agency \nregulations conflict with statutory text, statutory text wins out \nevery time. We simply cannot square [22 CFR 40.21(a)(5)] with the \ntext and structure of the INA as it was amended in 1990.\n\n    Wojciechowicz v. Garland, 77 F.4th 511, 514, 518 (7th Cir. 2023) \n(internal citations and parentheticals omitted). The Department agrees \nwith the Seventh Circuit's opinion in Wojciechowicz as it applies to \ngubernatorial pardons and finds that the court's analysis regarding the \nlack of underlying authority in the INA giving effect to such pardons \nalso extends to the Department's regulation at 22 CFR 40.22(c) \nregarding ineligibility for multiple criminal convictions.\n\nB. Legal Background\n\n    The Department first promulgated these rules in 1959 at 22 CFR \n41.91(a)(9)-(10).\\1\\ At the time the regulations were first \npromulgated, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended \n(``1952 Act''), provided that noncitizens were excludable \\2\\ from the \nUnited States and ineligible for visas if they had been convicted of a \ncrime involving moral turpitude or two or more criminal offenses. \nUnlike the 1952 Act's provisions on grounds of deportation, which did \nprovide that the criminal-related ground of deportation ``shall not \napply'' to individuals who had received a full and unconditional pardon \nby the President of the United States or by the Governor of any of the \nseveral States, the 1952 Act did not include a provision on the effect \nof a pardon on excludability. Section 222(a) of the 1952 Act did, \nhowever, speak to the possible relevance of a previous pardon or \namnesty to an individual's eligibility for an immigrant visa, requiring \nthat all immigrant visa applicants provide such information among a \nrange of other specified fields.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See 24 FR 6678 (Aug. 18, 1959).\n    \\2\\ The 1952 Act referred to ``classes of aliens [that] shall be \nineligible to receive visas and [that] shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States'' (emphasis added). The Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 \n(IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009-546, introduced the language of \n``inadmissible aliens'' as part of a broader reorganization of the \nINA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While the 1952 Act did not expressly include a provision on the \neffect of a pardon on excludability, the Board of Immigration Appeals \n(BIA) held in 1954 that such pardons also remove excludability under \nnow-INA section 212(a)(2)(A)(i). Matter of H--, 6 I&N Dec. 90, 96 (BIA \n1954) (``As long as there is a full and unconditional pardon granted by \nthe President or by a Governor of a State covering the crime which \nforms the ground of deportability, whether in exclusion or expulsion, \nthe immunizing feature of the pardon clause applies . . .'') (emphasis \nadded).\n    Following promulgation of the Department's 1959 rule, amendments to \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act and multiple court decisions have \nremoved any ambiguity about whether there is a statutory basis to \nexcept individuals from inadmissibility under INA section \n212(a)(2)(A)(i) or INA section 212(a)(2)(B) based on a gubernatorial \npardon. Congress revised the grounds of deportation relating to \nconvictions of crimes involving moral turpitude and aggravated felonies \nunder section 602(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (``IMMACT 90'') \nand, among the revisions, added a new clause to that ground expressly \nauthorizing waivers of that ground in cases of certain pardons, \nincluding gubernatorial pardons. In the same Act, Congress similarly \nrevised the INA's ground of inadmissibility in INA section \n212(a)(2)(A)(i) for conviction of certain crimes to include a separate \nclause of exceptions to that ground and did not include any such \nlanguage excepting applicants from ineligibility if their relevant \nconviction had been pardoned. Congress also subsequently amended INA \nsection 222(a) to no longer expressly require that all immigrant visa \napplicants provide information on a previous pardon or amnesty.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of \n1994, Public Law 103-416, Section 205(a).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In more recent years, courts have also consistently reached the \nopposite conclusion of Matter of H-- regarding the effect of a pardon \non a conviction that leads to criminal-related inadmissibility, like \nthe court's findings in Wojciechowicz. Each court that has considered \nthe effect of a gubernatorial pardon on admissibility has uniformly \nfound that Congress did not include an exception to inadmissibility \nunder INA section 212(a)(2)(A)(i) based on having received a pardon as \nit had done in the corresponding section outlining the criminal grounds \nfor deportation. For example, in Balogun vs. U.S. Attorney General, a \ncase involving a gubernatorial pardon, the Eleventh Circuit held that \nbecause the criminal-related inadmissibility ground ``does not have a \npardon provision like [8 U.S.C.]\n\n[[Page 67858]]\n\nsection 1227 does,'' the logical conclusion was that Congress must not \nhave ``intended to extend the pardon waiver to inadmissible aliens.'' \nBalogun v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 425 F.3d 1356, 1362 (11th Cir. 2005). The \nNinth Circuit subsequently reached the same conclusion in another case \ninvolving a gubernatorial pardon, with the court finding that the \n``statutory language dealing with pardons applies only to aliens who \nare charged based upon convictions under [8 U.S.C. 1227] . . . It does \nnot apply to aliens charged with inadmissibility under [8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)].'' Aguilero-Montero v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 1248, 1250 (9th Cir. \n2008).\n    Consistent with these courts' uniform findings on the issue, the \nBIA has also consistently reached the opposite conclusion of Matter of \nH--, and specifically held that the statutory language on effects of \npardons applies only to the criminal-related grounds of deportation and \nnot inadmissibility.\\4\\ See, e.g., Matter of Suh, 23 I&N Dec. 626, 628 \n(BIA 2003); Matter of Dillingham, 21 I&N Dec. 1001 (BIA 1997).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Wojciechowicz, as well as other judicial and administrative \ndecisions confronting the impact of a pardon on inadmissibility, \ninvolved pardons not issued by the President of the United States. \nThis rule implements Wojciechowicz's interpretation of the INA vis-\n[agrave]-vis a gubernatorial pardon, which the court found \nconflicted with the Department's regulation at 22 CFR 40.21(a)(5). \nThe Department therefore need not address whatever separation of \npowers concerns may or may not exist regarding the INA and the \nPresident's Article II pardon authority. See Aristy-Rosa v. Att'y \nGen., 994 F.3d 112, 117 (9th Cir. 2021) (``These separation of \npowers concerns are absent here, however, because Aristy-Rosa's case \nconcerns only a state pardon[.])''; see also Aguilera-Montero, 548 \nF3d at 1255 n.9.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While the Department agrees with the uniform findings from the \ncourts and the BIA that the text and structure of the INA do not \nprovide a basis for a pardon waiver of inadmissibility under INA \nsection 212(a)(2)(A)-(B), these cases do not address the constitutional \nauthority of the President to pardon an offense against the United \nStates, and the effect of such pardons on a criminal-related \ninadmissibility. Irrespective of express statutory authority to waive \nthe effects of a criminal conviction, a pardon granted by the President \nof the United States removes the attachment of all consequences based \non the offense. See U.S. Const. art. II, Sec.  2; Effects of a \nPresidential Pardon, 19 Op. O.L.C. 160 (1995) (quoting Ex Parte \nGarland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 380 (1866)). Consequently, this rule \nretains language in both regulations regarding the effect on \nineligibility under INA section 212(a)(2)(A)-(B) by reason of a \nconviction for which the President of the United States has granted a \nfull and unconditional pardon.\n    This rulemaking also removes references to the effect of a pardon \ngranted by either the former High Commissioner for Germany acting \npursuant to Executive Order 10062 or the U.S. Ambassador to the Federal \nRepublic of Germany acting pursuant to Executive Order 10608. These \nexecutive orders were issued in 1949 and 1955, respectively, and \npertained to the functions and authorities of the United States in \nGermany following World War II. Actions undertaken pursuant to these \nexecutive orders are now generally obsolete given the time that has \npassed since the United States occupied Germany. As these provisions \npertain to adjudication of visa applications from individuals granted \npardons under these executive orders, the provisions are now obsolete \nand are being removed in the interest of keeping Department regulations \nclear and up to date.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nA. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department is publishing this notice as an interpretative rule \nwhich, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), is not subject to \nthe general requirement for public notice and comment or the \nrequirement for a 30-day delayed effective date. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)-(c), \n(d)(2). ``[T]he critical feature of interpretive rules is that they are \nissued by an agency to advise the public of the agency's construction \nof the statutes and rules which it administers.'' Perez v. Mortgage \nBankers Ass'n, 575 U.S. 92, 97 (2015) (quoting Shalala v. Guernsey \nMem'l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 99 (1995)). As explained above, this rule \namends the existing regulation to implement the plain meaning of \nstatutory authorities and the President's constitutional authority \nregarding the effect of pardons on inadmissibility under INA sections \n212(a)(2)(A)(i) and 212(a)(2)(B). Any rule that is ``based on an \nagency's power to exercise its judgment as to how best to implement a \ngeneral statutory mandate'' is likely legislative. See United Tech. \nCorp. v. EPA, 821 F.2d 714, 720 (D.C. Cir. 1987). This rule, however, \nconveys the Department's interpretation of Congress having expressly \nnot provided an exception to inadmissibility based on a pardon, \nreflecting a plain reading of the inadmissibility ground in INA section \n212(a)(2)(A)(i) that multiple courts have shared; therefore, because it \nis not based in any exercise of the Department's judgment or discretion \nregarding these authorities, it is an interpretative rule.\n    Moreover, whether a rule is legislative or interpretative is \nassessed by reviewing a range of factors related to: (1) whether the \nagency would not have an adequate basis to perform duties in the \nabsence of the rule; (2) whether the agency has published the rule in \nthe Code of Federal Regulations; (3) whether the agency has explicitly \ninvoked a legislative authority; or (4) whether the rule effectively \namends a prior legislative rule. Am. Mining Cong. v. Mine Safety Health \nAdmin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 1993). If any of the answers to \nthese questions are affirmative, then the rule is considered \nlegislative and not interpretative. Id.\n    None of the factors in American Mining apply to this rule. First, \neven absent this rulemaking, the lack of any ambiguity regarding the \neffect of a gubernatorial pardon on a conviction of a crime involving \nmoral turpitude makes clear that the Department lacks authority to \nexcept applicants from ineligibility under INA section 212(a)(2)(A)-\n(B), regardless of this rule. Second, while this rule will result in an \namended regulation that is published in the Code of Federal \nRegulations, the changes are not based in legislative authority, which \nthe court in American Mining explained is the purpose of assessing \npublication there. See id. at 1109 (``[A]n agency seems likely to have \nintended a rule to be legislative if it has the rule published in the \nCode of Federal Regulations[.]''). Third, the Department is not \ninvoking its general legislative authority to support or justify this \nrule, as it is merely restating existing statutory and Constitutional \nauthority with respect to the effect of pardons. Id. at 1110; \nFertilizer Institute v. EPA, 935 F.2d 1303, 1308 (D.C. Cir. 1991). \nFinally, this rule does not amend a prior legislative rule, as a rule \ndoes not become an amendment of a prior legislative rule merely because \nit clarifies an authority being interpreted. See Id. at 1112 (``If that \nwere so, no rule could pass as an interpretation of a legislative rule \nunless it were confined to parroting the rule or replacing the original \nvagueness with a rule.''). The existing rule appears based on \nimplementation of a 1954 BIA decision for which courts have \nconsistently reached the opposite conclusion regarding authority in the \nINA to give effect to a pardon on a conviction of a crime involving \nmoral turpitude. See Matter of H--at 96. Consequently, the prior rule \nappears to have also been interpretative and not legislative.\n    As this rule amends visa policy, which is a foreign affairs \nfunction of the United States, it is also exempt from both the notice \nand comment and\n\n[[Page 67859]]\n\ndelayed effective date requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 per subsection \n(a)(1).\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    As this rulemaking is not required to be published for notice and \ncomment under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the regulatory \nflexibility analysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. Nonetheless, as this rule only directly impacts visa \napplicants, the Department certifies that this rule will not have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\nC. Congressional Review Act\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined by the Congressional \nReview Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.). This rule will not result in an \nannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase \nin costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, \nemployment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of \nUnited States-based companies to compete with foreign-based companies \nin domestic and import markets.\n\nD. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094\n\n    Executive Orders (E.O.) 12866, 13563, and 14094 do not apply to \nthis rule, as it pertains to a foreign affairs function.\\5\\ \nNotwithstanding the above, the Department has submitted this rule to \nOIRA for review and OIRA has deemed this rule not to be a significant \nregulatory action. For the reasons stated above, as this rule affects \nonly visa applicants, the Department is confident this rule will not \nresult in significant impacts to U.S. persons, including U.S. citizens \nor lawful permanent residents.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See E.O. 12866 Sec. 3(d)(2) (excepting from the definition \nof regulation those rules ``that pertain to a . . . foreign affairs \nfunction of the United States'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nE.

Timeline for Implementing Changes in the Final Rule\nV. Regulatory Analysis\n\nI. Introduction\n\n    This final rule amends 22 CFR part 96 and the changes clarify and \nupdate the 2006 final rule that established the regulatory framework \nfor the accreditation and approval function required under the 1993 \nHague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect \nof Intercountry Adoption (the Convention), the Intercountry Adoption \nAct of 2000 (IAA), and the Intercountry Adoption Universal \nAccreditation Act of 2012 (UAA). The Department drew from its 17 years \nof observations and experience with the accreditation regulations to \nreflect the rule's practical operation, and from the observations of \nadoption stakeholders including, but not limited to, adoptive parents, \nadoption service providers (ASPs), Congressional offices, adult \nadoptees, and law enforcement authorities.\n    On November 20, 2020, the Department published a notice of proposed \nrulemaking (NPRM, often referred in this preamble as the proposed \nrule). The proposed rule included changes to subparts A, B, E, F, L, \nand M and a new subpart R. The Department intends to examine changes to \nthe remaining subparts at a later time.\n    This final rule takes into account public comments received in \nresponse to the NPRM. The Department appreciates the extensive feedback \nreceived from stakeholders in response to the NPRM and notes the many \ncontributions from stakeholders who recommended substantive revisions \nto the Department's changes in the proposed rule. The final rule \nincorporates many of the substantive revisions proposed by the public. \nAdditionally, as explained below, this rule does not include three \nmajor sections of the proposed rule. The Department will consider \nconsultations with stakeholders before making further regulatory \nproposals relating to these three sections.\n\nII. Overview of Major Changes and Provisions in the Final Rule\n\n    This section of the final rule summarizes the major differences \nbetween the proposed rule and the final rule. This overview is followed \nin part III by a detailed, section-by-section discussion of significant \ncomments received in response to the NPRM.\n\nA. Adoption by Relatives\n\n    The long-anticipated \\1\\ new provisions on adoption by relatives \nwere welcomed by most commenters, though some thought the new \nprovisions did not go far enough in streamlining the required adoption \nservices and should have further limited the role of primary providers \nin relative cases. Most commenters, however, welcomed the simplified \nrole of the primary provider in the proposed rule requiring primary \nproviders to focus on three of the six adoption services listed in the \nCFR: \\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ The IAA provided in section 502(a) for establishment by \nregulation of alternative procedures for adoption of children by \nrelatives. The Department did not include alternative procedures for \nadoption by relatives in its accreditation rule published in 2006, \nwhich this rule amends, opting to pursue it later once the new \naccreditation rule was implemented. Adoption service providers with \nclients adopting relatives asked frequently over the intervening \nyears when the Department would produce alternative procedures for \nrelative cases.\n    \\2\\ 22 CFR 96.2 Definitions: Adoption service means any one of \nthe following six services:\n    (1) Identifying a child for adoption and arranging an adoption;\n    (2) Securing the necessary consent to termination of parental \nrights and to adoption;\n    (3) Performing a background study on a child or a home study on \na prospective adoptive parent(s), and reporting on such a study;\n    (4) Making non-judicial determinations of the best interests of \na child and the appropriateness of an adoptive placement for the \nchild;\n    (5) Monitoring a case after a child has been placed with \nprospective adoptive parent(s) until final adoption; or\n    (6) When necessary because of a disruption before final \nadoption, assuming custody and providing (including facilitating the \nprovision of) child care or any other social service pending an \nalternative placement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> (3) Performing a background study on a child or a home \nstudy on a prospective adoptive parent(s), and reporting on such a \nstudy;\n    <bullet> (5) Monitoring a case after a child has been placed with \nprospective adoptive parent(s) until final adoption; and\n    <bullet> (6) When necessary because of a disruption before final \nadoption, assuming custody and providing (including facilitating the \nprovision of) childcare or any other social service pending an \nalternative placement.\n    The new provisions in Sec.  96.100 allow a primary provider to \ndevelop and implement an adoption service plan addressing only three \nadoption services noted above in adoption by relatives. In all other \nintercountry adoptions, the primary provider must develop and implement \na service plan for providing all six adoption services, in accordance \nwith Sec.  96.44. The provisions in Sec.  96.100(d) require that the \nalternative procedures in Sec.  96.100 be performed in accordance with \nthe Convention, the IAA, the UAA and their implementing regulations.\n    Some commenters expressed the preference that post-placement \nmonitoring should not be required at all in adoptions by relatives. The \nDepartment emphasizes that post-placement monitoring mandated in the \nIAA remains an important element of the adoption services in the final \nrule,\n\n[[Page 57239]]\n\nincluding with respect to the adoption by relatives. Adoption services \nfive and six include essential services related to monitoring the \ncontinued well-being of the child's placement and to ensuring that the \nprospective adoptive parents can care for the particular needs of a \nchild. Unlike other services that may not be applicable or made \nredundant in the context of a pre-existing relationship, services 5 and \n6 apply equally whether or not the child is related to the prospective \nadoptive parents.\n    The public comments also revealed disagreement regarding how the \nterm ``relative'' should be defined and to which family relationships \nthe alternative procedures for primary providers should apply. Some \ncommenters preferred the relationships found in the regulations of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) at 8 CFR 204.309(b)(2)(iii) which \nare exempt from the prohibition on prior contact with a child's parents \nor caregivers. Section 96.2 Definitions includes a definition of \nrelative relationships that applies solely to determinations of when \nthose alternative procedures for primary providers in Sec.  96.100 may \nbe used. Although the Department's and DHS's definitions overlap quite \na bit, they differ enough in content and purpose that the Department \nretained its proposed definition of ``relative'' in the final rule. The \ndefinition of ``relative,'' and other public comments related to \nsubpart R are further addressed in the section-by-section discussion in \npart III, below, and in appendix A at the end of this notice.\n\nB. Compliance With All Applicable Laws\n\n    In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new section 96.29 in subpart \nF identifying conduct that does not conform to the regulatory framework \nof the IAA. Commenters found the new provisions to be duplicative and \npointed out that agencies and persons were already required to operate \nin accordance with the Convention, the IAA, the UAA, and their \nimplementing regulations. They suggested that restating the principle \nagain as a new standard in subpart F was not necessary. The final rule \ndoes not include a new section 96.29. The Department instead retained \nthe provisions on compliance with applicable laws in foreign countries \nin section 96.30 and renamed that section State Licensing and \nCompliance with All Applicable Laws. For a discussion of this and other \nprovisions proposed in section 96.29, see the public comment discussion \nof Sec.  96.29 in section III of this preamble.\n\nC. Child Care Payments\n\n    The changes to sections 96.36(a) and 96.40(c)(4) in the NPRM would \nhave prohibited ASPs from charging prospective adoptive parents for the \ncare of a particular child prior to the completion of the intercountry \nadoption process. Payments for specific child welfare activities, if \npermitted by the country of origin, are controversial because of the \npotential risk of diverting payments to support illicit practices such \nas recruiting children into institutions or incentivizing institutions \nto retain children longer than necessary, and as such, have been \nprohibited by many countries. The Department recognizes, however, that \nprohibiting such payments that could pay for essential needs such as \nfood, medical care, and other child welfare-related services may be \ndetrimental to children, particularly for children awaiting adoption \nwho have special needs.\n    Commenters pointed out that historically payments were allowed if \npermitted or required by the child's country of origin. Several \ncommenters noted the regularity with which the health of a child with \nspecial needs deteriorates and medical needs increase during the time \nbetween the referral and the final adoption, and that preventing \nfunding for such care, if permitted by the country of origin, would not \nbe in the best interests of the child. As discussed in section III of \nthis preamble, the Department did not retain in the final rule proposed \nchanges to Sec.  96.36(a). This final rule reinforces the standard in \nSec.  96.36(a) with changes to Sec.  96.36(b) that augment \nrecordkeeping requirements on the payment of fees in connection with \nintercountry adoption. Enhanced standards for recordkeeping will \nincrease the oversight of any permitted or required payments for \nspecific activities related to the adoption as outlined in Sec.  \n96.36(a). The recordkeeping requirements will help decrease the risk \nthat payments intended to benefit children will be diverted for illicit \npurposes. It will also assist agencies and persons to effectively \nmonitor and oversee payments and fees paid by their employees and \nsupervised providers in connection with an intercountry adoption. In no \ninstance shall permitted or required contributions be remitted as \npayment or as an inducement to release a child for adoption.\n\nD. Procedures and Requirements for Adverse Action by the Secretary, \nIncluding for Challenges to Such Adverse Action\n\n    The proposed changes to section 96.83 in subpart L impact \nprovisions regarding adverse action by the Secretary leading to \nsuspension or cancellation of an agency or person's accreditation or \napproval. The changes include procedural requirements for notifying \nagencies and persons of adverse actions taken by the Secretary and the \nreasons for such action. New sections 96.84(a) and (b) describe the \nadministrative process by which an ASP may request withdrawal of the \nsuspension or cancellation as unwarranted and the standards the \nDepartment will use to review such a request. The process mirrors \nprovisions in Sec.  96.76 in which an ASP may provide information to an \naccrediting entity to demonstrate that an adverse action was \nunwarranted. This process is independent of a petition for relief from \nthe Secretary's suspension or cancellation and is based upon the ASP's \ncorrection of deficiencies. A petition for relief is now addressed in \nSec.  96.84(c) and is similar to provisions in Sec.  96.78(a).\n    A number of commenters appreciated the introduction of due process \nfeatures when the Secretary imposes adverse action of suspension or \ncancellation. Other commenters thought accrediting entities should \nadhere to such procedures when imposing adverse actions, particularly \nproviding specific evidence relied on to support the adverse action. \nThe discussion in the section-by-section analysis for section 96.83 \nexplains that some due process provisions in Sec.  96.83 go farther \nthan those governing adverse action by accrediting entities in Sec.  \n96.76. This is largely because of the emergent nature of the conduct \ntriggering suspension or cancellation by the Secretary. Similarly, \nimposing adverse action before providing an opportunity to rebut the \nDepartment's conclusions is justified and often cannot wait when the \nimposition of adverse action relates to child safety or other serious \nor emergent compliance issues.\n    In 2016, the Department exercised its authority for the first time \nto debar an agency and determined based on that experience that it \nwould be beneficial to propose relevant details in the regulations as \nto the notice, evidentiary, and procedural requirements relating to \ndebarment proceedings. Section 96.88 sets forth the procedures, \nrequirements, time frames, and standards of review that apply when the \nDepartment\n\n[[Page 57240]]\n\nundertakes a debarment proceeding when prior notice is given. In Sec.  \n96.89, the Department sets forth the corresponding procedures, \nrequirements, time frames, and standards of review for debarment \neffective immediately, without prior notice. Some commenters objected \nto short time frames to obtain and present information in the \nproceedings and the lack of common procedural features such as \ndiscovery. They asserted the lack of discovery, for example, might \nprejudice the agency's or person's ability to respond fully to claims \nagainst it. The Department considers these and other comments relating \nto debarment proceeding procedures and requirements in the section-by-\nsection analysis in part III of this preamble, including appeal options \nin federal court and notification requirements when the Secretary \ndebars an accredited agency or approved person.\n\nE. Pausing on Revising Standards in Three Sections of Subpart F\n\n    The Department received public comments expressing concern or \ndisagreement about parts of the proposed changes in sections 96.40, \n96.50, and 96.54 in the proposed rule. The Department concluded that \nthe issues raised in these comments warrant further consideration. This \nfinal rule does not include revisions to these three sections. A brief \nsummary of the relevant comments and content of these sections follows:\nSec.  96.40: Fee Policies and Procedures\n    Comments submitted about standards relating to adoption fees and \nexpenses uniformly expressed concern with the way the Department \ncharacterized fees relating to intercountry adoption practice and the \nburden on adoption service providers to revise, recalculate, and report \nfee schedules conforming to the proposed changes. Commenters indicated \nthe proposed rubrics failed to reflect the way agencies and persons \nstructure their work as well as the flexibility needed to adapt to \ndynamic conditions.\nSec.  96.50: Placement and Post-Placement Monitoring Until Final \nAdoption in Incoming Cases\n    The revisions to Sec.  96.50 in the proposed rule would have \nexpanded required efforts by ASPs for taking action in the event of a \ndisruption and reporting to all relevant authorities about disruption \ncases. Commenters asserted the proposed changes would require \nsignificant resources to implement.\nSec.  96.54: Placement Standards in Outgoing Convention Cases\n    We received many comments relating to the proposed changes to this \nsection. The comments were against making any of our proposed changes, \narguing among other things that the provisions would have a negative \nimpact on outgoing adoption practice.\nTwo Additional Sections in Subpart F Ready for Renewed Consultations\n    Several commenters expressed strong interest in making changes to \ntwo additional sections in subpart F, sections 96.46 and 96.48.\nSec.  96.46: Using Providers in Foreign Countries\n    Regarding foreign supervised providers, in the proposed rule the \nDepartment acknowledged there were areas of discord relating to \noversight of foreign supervised providers. We stated our intention to \nundertake a consultative process on these issues that would consider \nthe entire range of standards relating to foreign supervised providers. \nIn addition to a few minor textual updates to Sec.  96.46 in the NPRM \nand in the final rule, we made changes to Sec.  96.46(b)(7) and (8) \nrequiring all payments to foreign supervised providers be provided \nthrough the primary provider. The primary provider must also provide \nprospective adoptive parents with a written explanation about the \nreturn of unused funds within 60 days.\nSec.  96.48: Preparation and Training of Prospective Adoptive Parents \nin Incoming Cases\n    Several commenters were disappointed that the proposed rule did not \namend the requirements for parent preparation and training. The \ncommenters expressed a need to increase the number of hours required \nfor parent preparation and welcomed an opportunity to collaborate on \nthe parameters of such training. No such changes are reflected in the \nfinal rule but further consideration will be given to these \nsuggestions.\n\nF. Other Significant Changes\n\nChanges to Elements in Subpart A, General Provisions\n    In the definitions section of the final rule, Sec.  96.2, we did \nnot retain the proposed definition of ``authorization.'' Commenters \nnoted this feature of the Hague Adoption Convention, Article 12, is \nalready incorporated into the regulations in the many references to \ncompliance with the Convention and further definition would be \nrepetitive.\n    In the final rule, we have kept several of the proposed changes to \nthe definition of ``best interests of the child'' in Sec.  96.2. The \ndefinition in the final rule clarifies how U.S. accredited and approved \nproviders should consider the best interests of a child when the child \nis abroad and outside the jurisdiction of a U.S. State. The NPRM only \nincluded a reference to the Convention in the proposed revision to the \ndefinition of best interests of the child. Based on public comments, \nthe definition in the final rule also includes a reference to the IAA, \nthe UAA, and their implementing regulations.\n    We made a change from the NPRM to the definition of ``supervised \nprovider,'' adding for clarity the term ``domestic or'' before the term \n``foreign entity.''\n    We did not retain a definition of ``unregulated custody transfer'' \n(UCT) in the NPRM, in response to comments noting that States have \njurisdiction over child welfare and protection matters, including what \nconstitutes UCT and any practice standards relating to it.\nChanges to Elements in Subpart B, Selection, Designation, and Duties of \nAccrediting Entities\n    Section 96.7 of the final rule retains the proposed revision in the \nNPRM requiring accrediting entities to retain all records relating to \naccreditation decision making for a period of 10 years. In response to \ncomments, this final rule provides for the Secretary to extend the time \naccrediting entities must retain documents, but not shorten it to less \nthan 10 years.\n    Section 96.8 of the final rule incorporates the proposed provisions \nestablishing a new process for reporting accrediting entity fee \nschedule changes in the Federal Register.\n    The Department retained the proposed change to Sec.  96.10 \npermitting a finding that accrediting entities are out of compliance \nfor approving or accrediting an agency or person when the Secretary had \nto intervene and itself impose suspension, cancellation, or debarment \nof an agency or person.\n    Section 96.12 of the final rule retains the minor edits in the \nNPRM, but it remains in subpart C.\nChanges to Elements in Subpart E, Evaluation of Applicants for \nAccreditation and Approval\n    In tandem with changes in section 96.7 as noted above, we retained \nin the final rule the proposed change to Sec.  96.26 requiring \naccrediting entities to retain an accurate record of accreditation and \napproval decision making for at least 10 years, or longer if the \nSecretary requires it.\n\n[[Page 57241]]\n\n    In Sec.  96.27(e) the final rule incorporates a proposed change \nrequiring accrediting entities to take into account in evaluating an \napplication for accreditation or approval the reasons underlying a \nprevious denial of accreditation or approval.\nChanges to Standards in Subpart F, Standards for Intercountry Adoption \nAccreditation and Approval\n    We did not retain proposed changes to Sec.  96.32 requiring \nagencies and persons to retain records related to the monitoring and \noversight of supervised providers for a period of not less than 25 \nyears. Several commenters expressed concern with the cost of \nimplementing these provisions. On balance, the cost of creating and \nretaining such records for 25 years and potentially even longer could \nnot be justified by the potential benefits.\n    Concerning the requirements in Sec.  96.33(e) relating to the cash \nreserve of two months operating expenses, in the final rule we did not \nretain the proposed deletion of ``financial resources'' in this \nstandard. Based on several public comments, we removed the reference to \nliquid assets. To avoid possible confusion or ambiguity as to these \nterms, the Department retained the existing CFR language in Sec.  \n96.33(e).\n    Section 96.34 of this final rule mandates that compensation must \nnot be unreasonably high but does not retain the proposed changes meant \nto take into account what services ``actually cost.'' Commenters found \nthe proposed formulation too vague for accrediting entities to \nimplement.\n    The Department accepted the recommendation by a commenter that \nseveral additional training topics be added to the list of topics in \nSec.  96.38. They relate to trauma-informed parenting, the impact of \nadoption on children already in the home, and parental support for \nchildren who experience discrimination based on race, physical, \ncognitive, and other disabilities.\n    Addressing questions raised in comments, section 96.41 of the final \nrule establishes that a complaint may be submitted by email, must \ninclude the name of the complainant and must be dated.\n    The final rule incorporates practical steps in Sec.  96.47 for \nwithdrawal of a home study recommendation that a family be found \nsuitable to adopt abroad, including timelines for notifying adoptive \nparents, primary providers, and USCIS. The final rule does not retain \nproposed changes to Sec.  96.52(a)(1) requiring extensive additional \nagency and person reporting to the Secretary and the foreign Central \nAuthority about ``material facts'' of intercountry adoption cases.\n\nIII. Section-by-Section Discussion of Comments\n\n    This section provides a detailed discussion of significant comments \nreceived and describes differences between the NPRM and this final \nrule.\n\nSubpart A--General Provisions\n\nSection 96.2 Definitions\n    1. Comment: Several commenters suggest edits to the proposed \ndefinition of ``authorization'' to clarify that such permission from a \nCentral Authority is for the ability to provide adoption services \ngenerally and not just for one specific adoption. The commenters also \nrecommend deleting the last sentence of the definition suggesting it \ngoes beyond the scope of defining the term.\n    Response: The final rule does not retain the proposed definition of \n``authorization.'' It also does not establish a standard for foreign \nauthorization. Where foreign countries require authorization to provide \nadoption services, agencies and persons are obliged to be in full \ncompliance with the laws of that foreign country in accordance with the \nnew section 96.30(e) in the final rule. For additional information, see \nthe discussion relating to section 96.29, below.\n    2. Comment: One commenter expresses concern that the proposed \nrevision to the definition of ``best interests of the child'' does not \nsufficiently reflect the provision of section 503(a) of the IAA (42 \nU.S.C. 14953(a)) that defers to State law unless such provisions are \ninconsistent with the Convention or the IAA. The commenter is concerned \nthe phrase ``without reference to the law of any particular State'' is \nin direct conflict with the IAA's objective to defer to State law \ndefinitions whenever possible. The commenter recommends deleting this \nreference and if it is retained, that in addition to the Convention, a \nreference to the IAA should also be added. The commenter is also \nconcerned that a reference to ``the object and purpose of the \nConvention'' could be interpreted to include provisions of other \ninternational conventions.\n    Response: The Department revised the definition of ``best interests \nof the child'' in the final rule to include a reference to the IAA, the \nUAA, and their implementing regulations to clarify that the revision \ndoes not include reference to any other international conventions. We \nhave also removed the reference to ``without reference to the law of a \nparticular State'' because we believe the intent of the regulation is \nclear without this specific reference. The Department does not agree \nthat the new definition is inconsistent with the IAA. The value of the \nrevised definition is that it provides useful information to agencies \nand persons about how to approach making determinations of the best \ninterests of a child when the child is outside of any State \njurisdiction. The definition affirms the central concept that in cases \nin which a State has jurisdiction to decide whether a particular \nadoption or adoption-related action is in a child's best interests, \n``best interests of the child'' shall have the meaning given to it by \nthe law of the State.\n    3. Comment: Some commenters are concerned the definition of ``best \ninterests of the child'' does not appropriately acknowledge the role \nplayed by central or competent authorities in making best interest \ndeterminations for children in countries of origin. The commenters note \nsuch determinations usually require judicial approval.\n    Response: The revised definition does not impose duties on public \nforeign authorities, who are expected to act in accordance with their \nown laws, regulations, and practices. In this final rule, to the extent \nthat accredited agencies and approved persons contribute to decisions \nor actions abroad regarding best interests of the child, the revised \ndefinition reinforces how the determination should be made. Section \n96.2 of the regulations specifically defines one of the six adoption \nservices as ``making non-judicial determinations of the best interests \nof the child and the appropriateness of an adoptive placement for a \nchild.'' The Department recognizes the role played by the competent \nauthority but does not agree this definition in the final rule \nconflicts with the role played by central or competent authorities in \nmaking a best interest determination for children. Rather, it clarifies \nthe guiding documents an agency or person should use when providing \nthis adoption service outside of a State jurisdiction.\n    4. Comment: One commenter proposes adding other people who could be \nparty to a service agreement in accordance with Sec.  96.44 to the \ndefinition of ``client,'' namely, birth parents in outgoing adoption \ncases. This commenter also recommends including the child who is being \nadopted in an outgoing adoption in the definition of ``client'' in \nSec.  96.2.\n    Response: Based on the public comments, we have withdrawn the \ndefinition of ``client.'' We agree that\n\n[[Page 57242]]\n\nonly referencing prospective adoptive parents in the definition of \nclient with respect to a service agreement may be unnecessarily \nlimiting, particularly with respect to outgoing adoptions. Given the \npossible different parties that could be included as clients for the \nservices agreement with an agency or person, the Department is not \nincluding a definition of ``client'' in Sec.  96.2 of the final rule.\n    5. Comment: Several commenters raise concerns about the addition of \na new definition of ``complaint'' in Sec.  96.2 and its impact on Sec.  \n96.41, procedures for responding to complaints and improving service \ndelivery.\n    Response: The final rule does not add a definition of \n``complaint.'' For comments and responses relating to the proposed \ndefinition of ``complaint'' together with a discussion of comments \nrelating to responding to complaints and related procedures, see Sec.  \n96.41, below.\n    6. Comment: Two commenters note the Department proposed changes to \nthe definition of ``public foreign authority'' by adding ``a court or \nregulatory'' before ``authority operated by a national or subnational \ngovernment of a foreign country'' but did not propose similar changes \nto the definition of ``public domestic authority.'' The commenters \nobject to the difference and are concerned the differences could cause \nconfusion, particularly the proposed changes to the definition of \npublic foreign authority.\n    Response: In response to these comments the Department is not \nincluding in the final rule the revisions to definitions of ``public \nforeign authority'' and ``public domestic authority.'' The Department \ndoes not want to create confusion between the definitions of \n``competent authority'' and ``public foreign authority'' as used in \nsections 96.12 and 96.14 which could make it more difficult to \ndetermine which entities require supervision.\n    7. Comment: Several commenters recommend the Department revise its \ndefinition of ``relative'' by using instead the list of relative \nrelationships found in 8 CFR 204.309(b)(2)(iii).\n    Response: This final rule retains the NPRM definition of \n``relative'' in Sec.  96.2. The Department believes the Sec.  96.2 \ndefinition of relative serves a purpose entirely different from the \ndefinition of relative found in DHS regulations at 8 CFR \n204.309(b)(2)(iii). Although there is significant overlap in the two \ndefinitions, their differences are also significant. See Appendix A at \nthe end of this notice showing how the two lists of relative \nrelationships overlap and how they differ in approach.\n    The DHS regulation at 8 CFR defines which pre-existing familial \nrelationships are exempt from the prohibition on prior contact between \na prospective adoptive parent and the prospective adoptive child's \nparents, legal custodian, or other individual or entity who is \nresponsible for the child's care. Additionally, the DHS regulation \ndefines such relative relationships in terms of the prospective \nadoptive parent's relationship with the parent of the child to be \nadopted. In contrast, the Department's final rule definition of \nrelative addresses relationships between the prospective adoptive \nparent(s) and the child to be adopted.\n    The relationships in the Department's definition of relative in \nSec.  96.2 include first- and second-degree relatives: parents and \nsiblings and grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews as well as \nanalogous relationships through marriage and adoption. These are all \nfamilial relationships that a primary provider can more readily \ndocument to determine whether a prospective adoptive parent has a \nqualifying relationship for the alternative procedures for primary \nproviders in Sec.  96.100. Relatives beyond the second degree such as \ngreat-grandparents, great aunts, great uncles and first and second \ncousins may still adopt relatives. However, primary providers in these \ncases would be required to develop a service plan for all six adoption \nservices and implement that plan in accordance with Sec.  96.44.\n    8. Comment: Commenters raised the concern that adoptive parents who \nadopt a child could assert a relative relationship with that child on \nthe basis of its adoption and thus avail themselves of the alternative \nprocedures for adoption by relatives in Sec.  96.100.\n    Response: The relationships within the definition of ``relative'' \nin Sec.  96.2 must exist between the prospective adoptive parent and \nthe child prior to initiating an adoption to be able to take advantage \nof the provisions in Sec.  96.100. For greater clarity, we revised the \ndefinition of ``relative'' as follows: ``Relative . . . means a \nprospective adoptive parent was already, before the adoption, any of \nthe following: parent, step-parent, etc. (emphasis added).''\n    9. Comment: One commenter is concerned that the addition of \n``person or'' after ``foreign'' in the definition of ``supervised \nprovider'' will cause ambiguity in the definition given that the phrase \n``person'' is first referred to in the definition of supervised \nprovider, without specific reference to ``foreign.'' The commenter \nsuggests adding a reference to ``domestic'' in addition to ``foreign'' \nto clarify the definition.\n    Response: The Department has modified the definition of \n``supervised provider'' to provide clarity. We included ``domestic or'' \nbefore the word ``foreign.''\n    10. Comment: Several commenters object to the phrase ``intent on \nsevering'' in the proposed definition of ``unregulated custody \ntransfer'' because it is ambiguous and does not explain how a parent's \nintention should be determined. Another commenter argues that the \ndefinition is unconstitutional because it treats parents by adoption \ndifferently from biological parents.\n    Response: The final rule does not contain a definition of \n``unregulated custody transfer.'' Given that the States have \njurisdiction over child welfare and protection matters and that some \nStates have already defined UCT, we defer to the States to determine \nwhat constitutes UCT rather than propose a definition in this rule.\n\nSubpart B--Selection, Designation, and Duties of Accrediting Entities\n\nSection 96.4 Designation of Accrediting Entities by the Secretary\n    1. Comment: Several commenters are concerned the proposed addition \nof ``under Sec.  96.5(b)'' to Sec.  96.4(c) will result in adoption \nservice providers losing the choice to select the accrediting entity \nthat conducts their accreditation or approval.\n    Response: Section 96.4(b) is unchanged in the final rule and \npermits the Secretary's designation of an accrediting entity to include \nlimitations on the accrediting entity's geographic jurisdiction or \nimpose other limits on the entity's jurisdiction. For clarity, the \nfinal rule retains the minor proposed change in Sec.  96.4(c), which \nconnects the reference to a public entity in Sec.  96.4(c) to the \nrequirements relating to public entities in Sec.  96.5(b).\nSection 96.6 Performance Criteria for Designation as an Accrediting \nEntity\n    1. Comment: One commenter suggests the Department is revising Sec.  \n96.6 to accommodate a specific accrediting entity.\n    Response: The Department made no changes in response to this \ncomment. Rather than addressing any one specific entity, the \nrequirements in Sec.  96.6 outline the performance criteria any \naccrediting entity must demonstrate to the Secretary when it is seeking \ndesignation as an accrediting entity. The changes to Sec.  96.6(c) and \n(d) clarify that an accrediting entity must demonstrate that it has the \ncapacity to monitor and take appropriate adverse actions against \nagencies and persons, even if did not initially accredit or approve \nthem. This change expands the performance criteria\n\n[[Page 57243]]\n\nthat must be demonstrated by an entity seeking designation by the \nDepartment.\nSection 96.7 Authorities and Responsibilities of an Accrediting Entity\n    1. Comment: A commenter noted in Sec.  96.7(a)(4) that the \nDepartment changed the function of the accrediting entities from \n``investigating'' complaints to ``reviewing'' complaints and asked for \nclarification of what review means in this context.\n    Response: The Department declines to further define ``review'' in \nthe final rule. Clarification of the meaning of the term ``review'' is \nincorporated in the Memoranda of Agreement between the accrediting \nentities and the Department and figures prominently in the Department-\napproved accrediting entity policies and procedures relating to \ncomplaints.\n    2. Comment: Several commenters recommend the Department specify in \nthe regulation that the Secretary could extend the time that an \naccrediting entity maintains all records related to its role as the \naccrediting entity.\n    Response: In response to these comments, Sec.  96.7(a)(9) and Sec.  \n96.26(d) of the final rule include a reference to ``longer if'' to \nclarify that ten years is the minimum amount of time for an accrediting \nentity to maintain its records, but the Secretary can extend it.\nSection 96.8 Fees Charged by Accrediting Entities\n    1. Comment: Several commenters expressed the belief that the \nDepartment should require more transparency of an accrediting entity's \ncosts to perform functions authorized by the Secretary by requiring it \nto make available, upon request from the public, its demonstration of \ncompliance with Sec.  96.8(a).\n    Response: The Department is not changing the rule to mandate that \naccrediting entities demonstrate to the public compliance with Sec.  \n96.8 as this regulation addresses the factors the Department will \nconsider, pursuant to Section 202(d) of the IAA, in deciding whether to \napprove an accrediting entity's proposed fee schedule. The language in \nthe proposed rule for Sec.  96.8(b) is the same in the final rule and \nrequires the Department to publish proposed fee schedules in the \nFederal Register for public comment. The Department believes this will \nincrease the transparency of an accrediting entity's fee schedules, \nparticularly proposed changes, while also adhering to the requirements \nin the IAA.\n    2. Comment: Several commenters suggest that fees charged by \naccrediting entities should be refundable for services not rendered. \nSeveral commenters also recommend the Department add a provision \nprohibiting accrediting entities from charging additional fees for \nsiblings.\n    Response: Section 96.8(c)(1) requires that the fees for \naccreditation and approval not be refundable. The Department is not \nchanging this provision because we believe it protects an accrediting \nentity's capacity to perform its roles and functions required by law \nand its agreement with the Department, while remaining consistent with \nSection 202(d) of the IAA. The Department does not agree that a new \nprovision should be added to restrict the possible fee structure for an \naccrediting entity; however, we encourage interested persons to utilize \nthe public comment process outlined in Sec.  96.8(b).\nSection 96.10 Suspension or Cancellation of the Designation of an \nAccrediting Entity by the Secretary\n    1. Comment: Several commenters propose adding the word \n``sufficient'' in front of evidence in Sec.  96.10(c)(1).\n    Response: The Department is not making any changes in response to \nthis comment because we do not agree ``evidence'' needs to be qualified \nin this standard. The procedures outlined in Sec.  96.10(b) provide the \naccrediting entity with an opportunity to demonstrate that suspension \nor cancellation by the Secretary is unwarranted, in accordance with the \nagreement with the Department pursuant to Sec.  96.9.\n\nSubpart E--Evaluation of Applicants for Accreditation and Approval\n\nSection 96.25 Access to Information and Documents Requested by the \nAccrediting Entity\n    1. Comment: One commenter is concerned the proposed change to Sec.  \n96.25 is overly broad and should specify that the intent of \n``deliberate destruction of documentation'' is to prevent an \naccrediting entity from accessing the documentation. Several commenters \nindicate support for the change but are concerned an accrediting entity \ncould take adverse action against an agency or person for following its \nown document retention and disposition policy. These commenters \nrecommend that an accrediting entity be required to provide notice \nspecifying which documentation and information the agency or person \nmust retain.\n    Response: Section 96.25(c) permits an accrediting entity to take \nappropriate adverse action against an agency or person based solely on \nan agency or person failing to provide requested documents or \ninformation to an accrediting entity. The final provision in Sec.  \n96.25(c) permits an accrediting entity to take appropriate adverse \naction if the agency or person ``engages in deliberate destruction of \ndocumentation or provides false or misleading documents or \ninformation'' to an accrediting entity. An accrediting entity requires \naccess to an agency or person's information and documents to perform \nits functions authorized by the Secretary. Section 96.25(a) outlines \nthe access and Sec.  96.25(b) limits the accrediting entity's access to \nConvention adoption files and cases subject to the UAA, with the \nexception of first-time applicants for accreditation or approval. The \nrequirements in this regulation, along with Sec.  96.42 on the \nretention, preservation, and disclosure of adoption records, provide \nsufficient information for an agency or person about the disclosure \nrequirements to an accrediting entity.\n    With regard to adverse action, section 96.76 outlines the \nprocedures governing adverse action by an accrediting entity. These \nprocedures would guide an accrediting entity's procedures for taking \nappropriate adverse action based on Sec.  96.25(c).\n    The Department has modified Sec.  96.25(c) in the final rule to \nclarify that the deliberate destruction of documentation relates to the \ndocuments or information requested by the accrediting entity that \nrequires or requests the documentation to evaluate an agency or person \nfor accreditation or approval and to perform its oversight, \nenforcement, renewal, data collection, and other functions.\nSection 96.26 Protection of Information and Documents by the \nAccrediting Entity\n    1. Comment: Several commenters disagree with adding ``foreign'' to \nSec.  96.26(b) because they do not think an accrediting entity should \nmake disclosures of information and documents to a foreign authority \nunless such disclosure falls into a circumstance outlined in Sec.  \n96.26(b). The commenters suggest such disclosures to a foreign \nauthority be coordinated through the Department of State.\n    Response: We have made a change to Sec.  96.26(b) by removing the \nterm ``foreign'' as recommended. This change clarifies that documents \nand information may not be disclosed by an accrediting entity to a \nforeign authority unless the disclosure meets the circumstances \noutlined in Sec.  96.26(b)(1) through (3).\n    2. Comment: Several commenters are concerned Sec.  96.26(d) would \nlimit the requirements for an accrediting entity to\n\n[[Page 57244]]\n\nmaintain accurate records. The commenters suggest this could weaken the \nDepartment of State's oversight of an accredited entity.\n    Response: Section 96.26(d), formerly the last sentence of Sec.  \n96.26(c), clarifies the minimum period for an accrediting entity to \nmaintain complete and accurate records of all information it receives \nrelated to an agency or person and the basis for accrediting entity \ndecisions concerning the agency or person. The Department has made a \nchange to clarify that the Secretary will only lengthen, not shorten, \nthe requirement for an accrediting entity to maintain a complete and \naccurate record of all information it receives related to an agency or \nperson, and the basis for an accrediting entity's decisions concerning \nthe agency or person.\n    3. Comment: Several commenters suggest requiring an accrediting \nentity to disclose to an agency or person any information or records \nthe accrediting entity uses as the basis of an adverse action.\n    Response: We did not make any changes in response to this comment. \nThe Department did not propose changes to subpart K, which includes \nprocedures and responsibilities of an accrediting entity for decisions \nleading to the imposition of adverse action.\nSection 96.27 Substantive Criteria for Evaluating Applicants for \nAccreditation or Approval\n    1. Comment: Several commenters are concerned that removing the word \n``only'' from Sec.  96.27(c) would allow an accrediting entity greater \nflexibility and discretion, outside the scope of subpart F, when \nevaluating applicants for accreditation or approval.\n    Response: To avoid any confusion about how the standards are \napplied, we have not included the proposed changes to Sec.  96.27(c) in \nthe final rule.\n\nSubpart F--Standards for Convention Accreditation and Approval\n\nSection 96.29 Compliance With All Applicable Laws\n    1. Comment: Commenters object to the provisions in the proposed \nSec.  96.29(a) requiring that an agency or person has not provided any \nadoption service without accreditation or approval, or as an exempted \nor supervised provider. Commenters also object to the proposed \nrequirement that an agency or person demonstrate it has not provided \nany adoption services in a foreign country without authorization. In \naddition, commenters point out that these prohibitions are not \nconstrained in time, not limited in terms of pre- or post-IAA or \nConvention, nor do they contemplate how agencies and persons must \ndocument their compliance.\n    Response: The Department is reorganizing the material in Sec.  \n96.29 and has removed the proposed Sec.  96.29(a) from subpart F. The \nprovisions in the proposed Sec.  96.29(b) are already included in Sec.  \n96.25 where issues relating to an accrediting entity's access to \ninformation and documents are found. The parts of the proposed Sec.  \n96.29(c) and (d) relating to compliance with the laws of jurisdictions \nwhere agencies and persons provide adoption services are now retained \nin Sec.  96.30(e). For information about disposition of provisions in \nthe proposed Sec.  96.29 relating to foreign country authorization in \nline with Convention Article 12, see comment 4, below.\n    2. Comment: Several commenters are concerned with the provisions in \nthe proposed Sec.  96.29(d) concerning compliance with the laws of each \njurisdiction in which an agency or person operates. They state that \nforeign laws are often vague or contradictory and compliance is \ndifficult to achieve. Some also note that even when laws are clear, \nsome countries of origin lack the infrastructure to act on them quickly \nenough to meet urgent needs of children waiting for intercountry \nadoption placements.\n    Response: The requirement for agencies and persons to act in \ncompliance with all applicable laws tracks closely with the minimum \nrequirements of the accreditation regulations in the IAA found in \nSection 203(b)(1)(F) (42 U.S.C. 14923(b)(1)(F)): ``The agency has \nestablished adequate measures to comply (and to ensure compliance of \ntheirs and clients) with the Convention, this chapter, and any other \napplicable law.'' To clarify the provisions relating to compliance with \nall applicable laws, the final rule includes the first sentence of the \nproposed language of Sec.  96.29(d) as new section 96.30(e).\n    3. Comment: Several commenters note that even when laws in some \ncountries of origin are known there may be different interpretations of \nlaws as well as waivers or exceptions that may be informally permitted \nand unevenly administered. These factors make it difficult to determine \ncompliance with applicable foreign laws. Commenters recommend that \nissues of compliance with foreign laws be referred to law enforcement, \nnoting further their belief that it is not an accrediting entity role \nto unilaterally determine if an agency has violated a law. The \ncommenters question the practicality of expecting accrediting entities \nto have and maintain expertise in domestic and foreign law.\n    Response: The IAA gives accrediting entities the responsibility to \nassess agency and person substantial compliance with accreditation \nstandards, which include requirements to comply with applicable foreign \nlaws. Law enforcement concerns may emerge in the context of an \naccrediting entity's accreditation, approval, or monitoring and \noversight of an agency or person and, where appropriate, the agency's \nor person's conduct may be referred to law enforcement entities for \ninvestigation and possible prosecution. The role of law enforcement is \nseparate from that of an accrediting entity, which is to provide \nmonitoring and oversight of an agency's or person's compliance with \nstandards for accreditation and approval.\n    4. Comment: Several commenters observe that the proposed rule \nintroduces a new standard in the proposed Sec. Sec.  96.29(a), (c), and \n(d) requiring foreign country authorization to provide adoption \nservices in countries requiring such authorization. They note that \ndetermining country of origin authorization requirements can be \ndifficult.\n    Response: The Department removed the specific references to foreign \ncountry authorization in the final rule. However, if a country of \norigin requires authorization in the context of obligations under \nArticle 12, an agency or person must obtain such authorization to \ncomply fully with the laws of the foreign country where they or it \noperates.\nLicensing, Compliance With Applicable Laws, and Corporate Governance\nSection 96.30 State Licensing and Compliance With All Applicable Laws\n    The Department is revising the heading associated with this Section \nand adding Sec.  96.30(e), formerly the first half of the proposed \nSec.  96.29(d).\nSection 96.32 Internal Structure and Oversight\n    1. Comment: Many commenters oppose the proposed retention \nrequirements for records relating to the selection, monitoring, and \noversight of foreign supervised providers, financial transactions to \nand from foreign countries, and records relating to complaints. The \ncommenters are concerned this new requirement will significantly \nincrease the costs to an agency or person to comply with the new \nstandard for document retention. Several commenters note Sec.  96.42\n\n[[Page 57245]]\n\nincludes the requirements for the retention, preservation, and \ndisclosure of adoption records. The commenters note the retention \nrequirement in Sec.  96.42 for adoption records defers to applicable \nState law, which may require adoption records be retained permanently. \nSeveral commenters are also concerned that the change to the standard \ncould violate State laws in some jurisdictions.\n    Response: In response to public comments, the final rule does not \ninclude the provision in Sec.  96.32(c) of the NPRM. The final rule \ncontinues to require the agency or person to keep permanent records of \nthe meetings and deliberations of its governing body and of its major \ndecisions affecting the delivery of adoption services.\nFinancial and Risk Management\nSection 96.33 Budget, Audit, Insurance, and Risk Assessment \nRequirements\n    1. Comment: Commenters want the term ``liquid assets'' removed from \nthe proposed changes to Sec.  96.33(e) because ``liquid assets'' are \nalready included in the standard, as ``liquid assets'' are a type of \nasset. The commenters suggest using the term ``or other assets,'' which \nis inclusive of liquid assets. Commenters are also concerned that \nemphasizing liquid assets will make it more difficult for smaller \nagencies and persons to keep sufficient assets liquid and in reserve.\n    Response: The final rule does not include the proposed reference to \nliquid assets. Also, the final rule does not retain the proposed \ndeletion of ``financial resources.'' To avoid possible confusion or \nambiguity as to these terms, the Department retained the existing CFR \nlanguage in Sec.  96.33(e).\n    2. Comment: Several commenters recommend the reserve requirement \nshould apply only to an agency or person's intercountry adoption work. \nThese commenters note that it is more challenging for agencies and \npersons that operate non-adoption programs to meet the reserve \nrequirement of the standard.\n    Response: We have not included limiting the cash and other asset \nreserves solely to an agency or person's intercountry adoption \nprograms. The reserve provisions are meant to protect prospective \nadoptive families by considering the financial viability of the entire \norganization, including where the agency or person engages in other \nwork beyond intercountry adoption.\n    3. Comment: One commenter requests the Department clarify why it is \nmoving the last sentences of Sec.  96.33(e) to a new section, Sec.  \n96.33(f). The commenter notes if an agency or person ceases to provide \nor is no longer permitted to provide adoption services in intercountry \nadoption cases, the transfer plan required by the standard is not \nenforceable. The commenter notes agencies and persons are increasingly \nunwilling to accept transfer cases due to concerns that the agency or \nperson may be found out of substantial compliance with the regulations. \nThe commenter suggests the Department should play a greater role \nhelping agencies and persons to transfer adoption cases and records.\n    Response: Section 96.33(f) remains unchanged from its formulation \nin the proposed rule. The standard requires an agency or person to have \na plan to transfer its intercountry adoption cases if it ceases to \nprovide or is no longer able to provide adoption services in \nintercountry adoption cases. Making a transfer plan benefits adoptive \nfamilies in the process of adopting because it includes provisions for \nreimbursement to them of funds paid for services not yet rendered. For \npurposes of clarity, we have included this standard in its own section. \nThe Department's role when an agency or person is unable to transfer \nits intercountry adoption cases consistent with its plan is outlined in \nSec. Sec.  96.7 and 96.77.\nSection 96.34 Compensation\n    1. Comment: Several commenters request clarification about the \nmeaning of a ``plan to compensate'' in Sec.  96.34(a). These commenters \nrecommend that the Department use the phrase ``or offers to \ncompensate'' to clarify the requirement of the standard.\n    Response: We have modified Sec.  96.34(a) to clarify that any \npayment or offer of payment that includes an incentive fee or \ncontingent fee for a child placed for adoption is not in compliance \nwith this standard. The final rule broadens the requirement to ensure \nthat any individual or entity involved in an intercountry adoption is \nnot compensated with an incentive fee or contingent fee for a child \nlocated or placed for adoption. The final rule addresses known \npractices to circumvent this limitation on the payment of incentive and \ncontingent fees.\n    2. Comment: In several sections of the proposed rule commenters \nexpressed uncertainty of our meaning when we inserted the term ``or \nentity'' after the word ``individual.''\n    Response: The Department made no change in response to the comments \nregarding use of the terms ``individual'' or ``entity.'' In their \ncommon usage, the terms differentiate between a single person--an \nindividual--and a group of individuals such as a corporation or \nagency--an entity. This distinction helps to clarify that the \ncompensation limits in Sec.  96.34 have broad application.\n    3. Comment: In Sec.  96.34(d), commenters oppose the proposed \nformulation ``what such services actually cost'' in the country for \nlack of clarity, particularly regarding who determines what services \nactually cost in every country program. The commenters also point out \nthat what a service costs is influenced by many factors, and that it \nwill be difficult for an accrediting entity to determine actual costs \ngiven the variables involved.\n    Response: The standard in Sec.  96.34(d) relates to avoiding \nunreasonably high fees, wages or salaries paid to directors, officers, \nemployees, and supervised providers along with any other individual, or \nentity involved on behalf of an agency or person. The Department has \nnot retained the proposed phrase ``what services actually cost,'' \nincluding instead ``taking into account the country in which the \nservices are provided and norms for compensation within the \nintercountry adoption community in that country, to the extent that \nsuch norms are known to the accrediting entity.'' This standard \nprovides several factors to consider in making such a determination \nincluding, the country, the location, number, and qualifications of \nstaff, workload requirements, budget, and the size of the agency or \nperson (such as a for-profit organization).\nEthical Practices and Responsibilities\nSection 96.35 Suitability of Agencies and Persons To Provide Adoption \nServices Consistent With the Convention\n    1. Comment: A commenter requests clarification as to whether the \nnew disclosure requirement in Sec.  96.35(b)(6) relates to \ninvestigations by foreign authorities that are known to an agency or \nperson.\n    Response: Section 96.35(b)(6) adds a new element to the disclosure \nrequirement relating to any known past or pending investigations by \nforeign authorities.\n    2. Comment: A commenter raised a concern about a disclosure \nrequirement in Sec.  96.35(b)(7) that an agency of person must disclose \n``any instances where the agency or person has been found guilty of any \ncrime under Federal, State, or foreign law . . .'' The commenter \npointed out that in some criminal cases a defendant may be permitted by \nthe court to enter a plea of nolo contendere resulting in a conviction, \nbut without\n\n[[Page 57246]]\n\nadmission or finding of guilt. The commenter was concerned that an \nagency or person may have been convicted of illicit activity without \nbeing found guilty and would not be under obligation to disclose the \nconviction.\n    Response: The Department made no changes to this section. We \ndecline to look behind the court's acceptance of the nolo contendere \nplea. Only those convictions in which an agency or person is found \nguilty of a crime requires disclosure under Sec.  96.35(b)(7). We note \nthat other parts of Sec.  96.35, i.e., paragraphs (b)(9) and (c)(1), \nmay require disclosure of conduct of concern that leads to a conviction \neven without specifying guilt, or that is inconsistent with the \nprinciples of the Convention.\n    3. Comment: One commenter is concerned the proposed change in Sec.  \n96.35(b)(9) from activities that ``are'' inconsistent with the \nprinciples of the Convention to activities that ``may be'' inconsistent \ncould create ambiguity for an agency or person about the disclosures \nrequired by this standard.\n    Response: The Department removed the proposed changes to ``may be'' \nin Sec. Sec.  96.35(b)(9) and 96.35(c)(4) replacing them with ``are.''\n    4. Comment: Commenters are concerned in Sec.  96.35(c)(2) that the \nbroader language requiring disclosure of employees with formal \ndisciplinary actions or known investigations might be too broad because \nit would include employees who are not involved in the adoption \nprocess. One commenter suggests the new standard would require an \nagency or person to disclose to an accrediting entity any disciplinary \nactions, such as reporting late to work.\n    Response: The Department has revised the standard to revert to the \nlanguage limiting the section to senior management positions but has \nretained the language adding formal disciplinary actions. Disciplinary \naction taken against employees at any level relating to lateness for \nwork would fall outside the scope of these changes because they are not \nrelated to financial irregularities. Furthermore, the scope of these \nchanges in this section is likely to reassure prospective adoptive \nparents that agencies and persons do due diligence across their entire \norganization to detect and address financial irregularities by senior \nmanagement.\nSection 96.36 Prohibition on Child Buying and Inducement\n    1. Comment: Some commenters are concerned the proposed changes to \nSec.  96.36(a) would restrict agencies and persons from remitting \nreasonable payments for activities related to the adoption as outlined \nin the current Sec.  96.36(a) as long as such payments are permitted by \nthe child's country of origin and are not remitted as a payment or \ninducement to release the child. One commenter states that this change \nwould prohibit an agency or person from making reasonable payments to \naddress often severe medical needs for a child who had already been \nmatched with prospective adoptive parents. The commenter notes that \nprohibiting such payment could be harmful to the best interests of a \nchild.\n    Response: In response to these comments, the Department has revised \nSec.  96.36(a), reintroducing the deleted portion relating to \n``reasonable payments.'' We have also retained language in Sec.  \n96.36(a) clearly prohibiting agencies and persons from ``giving money \nor other consideration, directly or indirectly, to a child's parent(s), \nother individual(s), or an entity as payment for the child or as an \ninducement to release the child.'' As we noted in 71 FR 8063, February \n15, 2006, ``This standard, derived from the current, longstanding DHS \nregulations at 8 CFR 204.3, protects birth parents, children, and \nadoptive parents. Regardless of how adoption services fees are \ndescribed, characterized, or classified, if the fee is remitted as \npayment for the child, or as an inducement to release the child, then \nthe standard is violated and appropriate action may be taken against an \nagency or person.'' This standard is also consistent with DHS \nregulations at 8 CFR 204.304, which prohibit in Convention cases the \nimproper inducement or influence of any decision concerning the \nplacement of a child for adoption, consent to the adoption of a child, \nrelinquishment of a child for purposes of adoption, or performance of \nany act by the child's parents that make the child eligible for \nclassification as a Convention adoptee.\n    2. Comment: Commenters point out that the term ``inducement'' \n(found in both the current and proposed regulations at Sec.  96.36(a)) \nis not defined in these regulations and suggests that the Department \ninclude a definition for this term that makes clear it would only be \nprohibiting ``illicit'' inducement.\n    Response: The Department made no changes in response to these \ncomments. Inducement in the context of this rule and in the DHS \nregulations governing the intercountry adoption of children from non-\nConvention countries under section 101(b)(1)(F) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (INA) (8 CFR 204.3(i)) and governing Convention \nadoptions under INA 101(b)(1)(G) (8 CFR 204.304(a)) refer to ``the act \nof influencing an act or decision'' and clearly encompasses the illicit \nconduct that the IAA and the Convention seek to eradicate. Whatever \nother benign meanings the term may have clearly do not apply here. The \nheading to Sec.  96.36 already unambiguously employs the term \n``inducement,'' associating it with the term ``child buying,'' leaving \nno question that ``inducement'' here refers to illicit conduct.\n    3. Comment: A commenter is concerned that the term ``agent'' has \nbeen too broadly interpreted and recommended we provide additional \nclarification.\n    Response: To refine the standard in Sec.  96.36(b), the Department \nadded the term ``supervised'' and removed the term ``and agents'' from \nthe section. These changes are consistent with the definition of \n``supervised provider'' in Sec.  96.2, which makes clear that \n``agents'' are encompassed in the meaning of supervised provider.\nProfessional Qualifications and Training for Employees\nSection 96.37 Education and Experience Requirements for Social Service \nPersonnel\n    1. Comment: One commenter is concerned with the reference to \n``counseling'' in Sec.  96.37(a) and recommends changing it to \n``assessment'' to more accurately reflect the services provided by \nagencies and persons.\n    Response: Apart from adding a heading to Sec.  96.37(a), the \nDepartment did not propose a substantive change to this standard. \nSection 96.37(a) applies to employees of an agency or person with \nappropriate qualifications and credentials to perform work requiring \napplication of clinical skills and judgment. This standard does not \nrequire that an agency or person have employees that provide all of the \nadoption-related social service functions outlined in Sec.  96.37(a), \nbut it does require that if an agency or person uses employees for such \nfunctions, that any such employee have the appropriate qualifications \nand credentials to perform functions requiring clinical skills and \njudgment, counseling among them.\n    2. Comment: A commenter suggests that the proposed change to Sec.  \n96.37 adding ``training'' to the standard is duplicative of the \ntraining requirements for social service personnel in Sec.  96.38 and \nshould be deleted.\n    Response: The Department has retained the proposed change to Sec.  \n96.37(c) thus expanding the existing standard to include training in \nthe\n\n[[Page 57247]]\n\nprofessional delivery of intercountry adoption services for the agency \nor person's executive director, the supervisor overseeing a case, or \nthe social service employee providing adoption-related social services \nthat require the application of clinical skills and judgment. This \naspect of the standard is not addressed in other areas of the \nregulations.\n    3. Comment: One commenter requests clarification about why the \nDepartment proposes to include headings for Sec.  96.37(a), (b), and \n(c) and if the headings provide a change to the meaning of the \nstandard.\n    Response: Section 96.37 has four paragraphs with headings. The \nDepartment added headings to the other parts of the standard to enhance \nclarity, not to change the underlying meaning of the existing \nregulation.\nSection 96.38 Training Requirements for Social Service Personnel\n    1. Comment: One commenter seeks clarification as to whether in \naccordance with Sec.  96.38(d) an agency or person has the discretion \nto exempt newly hired employees as it relates to Sec.  96.38(b). Also, \nthe commenter thinks the use of the term ``exemption'' in the context \nof this section needs clarification.\n    Response: We have modified Sec.  96.38(d) to make it clear that an \nagency or person may, but is not required to, exempt newly hired \nemployees from elements of the orientation and initial training \nrequired in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Such an exemption \nis only permitted if the newly hired employee was employed by an agency \nor person within the last two years and received the training \nrequirements outlined in Sec. Sec.  96.38, 96.39, and 96.40. Note that \nany exemption under Sec.  96.38(d) is made solely by the employing \nagency or person, who have no need to seek such exemptions from another \nentity. We use this term ``to exempt'' or ``exemption from'' to mean \n``relieved from requirements'' elsewhere in this or other training \nsections of the rule.\n    2. Comment: A commenter suggests adding in Sec.  96.38(b) several \nnew areas for training social service personnel and recommends adding \nseveral additional topics to the standard.\n    Response: The Department revised the list of topics to include \nadditional training requirements for social service personnel.\n    3. Comment: A commenter asks why the Department employed the term \n``sociological . . . problems'' in Sec.  96.38(b)(7) and asked for \nclarification, particularly related to the proposed language related to \nthe possibility that such problems may not be reflected in the medical \nreports transmitted to prospective adoptive parents.\n    Response: The Department revised the final rule by removing the \nterm ``sociological'' from Sec.  96.38(b)(7), relying on the remaining \nelements of this section to inform training relating to medical and \npsychological problems experienced by children and the possibility that \nsuch problems may not be reflected in the medical reports transmitted \nto prospective adoptive parents.\nInformation Disclosure, Fee Practices, and Quality Control Policies and \nPractices\nSection 96.39 Information Disclosure and Quality Control Practices\n    1. Comment: Some commenters think the new provisions in Sec.  \n96.39(a)(1) are unduly burdensome for agencies and persons to disclose \ndetailed fee information about supervised and exempted providers to \nprospective adoptive parent(s) on initial contact.\n    Response: In response to these comments, the Department has made \nseveral revisions to Sec.  96.39 in the final rule. The final rule \nrequires an agency or person to fully disclose to the general public \nand prospective client(s) the supervised providers in the United States \nand in the child's country of origin with whom they can expect to work \nand the usual costs associated with their services.\nResponding to Complaints and Records and Report Management\nSection 96.41 Procedures for Responding to Complaints and Improving \nService Delivery\n    1. Comment: Several commenters raise concerns that the new \ndefinition of ``complaint'' and the changes in Sec.  96.41(b) will \nincrease the number of complaints and require significantly more \ndisclosures to the Department pursuant to Sec.  96.41(f). Commenters \nalso state that the proposed changes expand the scope of complaints and \nwould require agencies and persons to accept complaints from any \nindividual or entity, even about matters unrelated to their \nintercountry adoption practice.\n    Response: The Department withdraws the proposed definition of \n``complaint'' and the proposed changes to Sec.  96.41(b), retaining a \nreference to written or electronic and dated complaint submissions (by \nemail or facsimile) in which the complainant is clearly identified. \nThese changes recognize the validity of electronic forms of complaint \nand the value of complaints from birth parents, prospective adoptive \nparents, adoptive parents, or adoptees. Tracking and summarizing the \ncomplaints received pursuant to Sec.  96.41(b) provides useful \ninformation regarding trends to agencies and persons, accrediting \nentities, and the Department.\n    2. Comment: Several commenters object to removing the language in \nSec.  96.41(b) that agencies and persons accept complaints from a \ncomplainant ``that he or she believes raise an issue of compliance with \nthe Convention, the IAA, the UAA, or the regulations implementing the \nIAA or UAA.'' The commenters also raise concerns about the proposed \ndefinition of complaint in Sec.  96.2, noting that its formulation used \n``may raise an issue of non-compliance with the Convention, the IAA, \nthe UAA, or the regulations implementing the IAA and the UAA,'' was \ndifferent from the reference in Sec.  96.41(b) of ``he or she believes \nraise an issue of compliance.'' The commenters are concerned that the \nuse of ``may raise'' in the definition along with the perception that \nindividuals and entities could submit complaints directly to the \nDepartment would sidestep the process for filing complaints outlined in \nSec. Sec.  96.69-71.\n    Response: To improve clarity, the final rule does not include a \ndefinition of complaint in Sec.  96.2. The final rule includes the \nreference to and most of the revisions to Sec.  96.41(b) (as noted in \nits response to comment 1, above) returning to the formulation ``he or \nshe believes raise an issue of. . . .''\n    3. Comment: One commenter expresses concern that the changes to \nSec.  96.41(b) and to the new definition of complaint would permit \ncomplaints filed by anyone electronically without identifying the \ncomplainant. As written, this commenter thinks the changes would \nencourage anonymous complaints and that agencies and persons would be \nrequired to, but unable to, respond to such complaints.\n    Response: In the final rule, the Department provides for electronic \nsubmission of complaints without a written signature to facilitate use \nof electronic means of communication while at the same time adding \nclear requirements to the standard in Sec.  96.41(b) that each \ncomplaint must be dated and identify the complainant.\n    4. Comment: A commenter believes provisions in the proposed \ncomplaint definition allow for filing complaints directly with an \naccrediting entity, the Department, and even the Complaint Registry, \nwhich would create a direct contradiction to Sec. Sec.  96.69(b) and \n96.71(b)(1). Section 96.69(b) requires complainants who are parties to \na specific intercountry adoption case to first file a complaint and \nattempt to seek\n\n[[Page 57248]]\n\nresolution with an agency or person before filing with the Complaint \nRegistry.\n    Response: We have withdrawn the new definition of complaint from \nthe final rule, which removes the changes noted above that the \ncommenter found suggestive of being contrary to the complaint \nprocedures found in Sec. Sec.  96.69 and 96.71.\nSection 96.42 Retention, Preservation, and Disclosure of Adoption \nRecords\n    1. Comment: One commenter, while not opposed to the revision, asked \nwhy it was necessary to include a reference to State law in Sec.  \n96.42(b).\n    Response: The Department added a reference to State law because the \nproposed rule broadens the disclosure requirements by deleting ``non-\nidentifying'' from ``information.'' Section 401(c) of the IAA mandates \nthat applicable State law govern the disclosure of adoption records and \nState law may limit the information an agency or person may make \navailable to an adoptee or adoptive parent(s) of minor children.\nSection 96.43 Case Tracking, Data Management, and Reporting\n    1. Comment: Several commenters request the Department add \n``whenever possible . . .'' for information and reports on disruptions \nin Sec.  96.43(b)(3) as it is in the rule for dissolutions in Sec.  \n96.43(b)(4). The commenters maintain obtaining the requested \ninformation is difficult, particularly when adoptive parents are \nunwilling to provide the information to the agency or person.\n    Response: In response to public comments, the final rule reflects \nthe removal of all proposed changes to Sec.  96.43. Cooperation between \nthe Department, the accrediting entities, and agencies and persons in \nrecent years with regard to adoption instability matters, including \nreporting on disruption cases, has proven to be robust and effective. \nThe proposed expanded reporting for disrupted placements includes \ninformation that is often already provided by agencies and persons \nreporting on disrupted placements.\n    2. Comment: Several commenters note that removing the phrase ``set \nforth in the country of origin,'' in Sec.  96.43(b)(6) significantly \nbroadens the scope of information agencies and persons will be required \nto provide the Department. The commenters also note agencies and \npersons would need time to comply with the reporting requirement due to \nthe proposed significant changes to Sec.  96.40.\n    Response: The final rule reflects the removal of all proposed \nchanges to Sec.  96.43 and continues to reflect the annual reporting \nrequirement in section 104(b)(7) of the IAA. (42 U.S.C. Ch 143 Sec.  \n14914 (b)(7)).\nService Planning and Delivery\nSection 96.45 Using Supervised Providers in the United States\n    1. Comment: Several commenters are concerned with the proposed \nchanges in Sec.  96.45(a)(2) requiring supervised provider compliance \nwith the Convention, the IAA, the UAA, and their implementing \nregulations. One commenter thinks the proposed regulation is overly \nbroad and tantamount to requiring supervised providers to become \naccredited to comply with the standard. The commenter recommends \nlimiting the provision as follows: ``In providing any adoption service, \ncomplies with the relevant section of the Convention, the IAA, the UAA, \nand regulations implementing the IAA and UAA for the adoption service \nbeing provided.''\n    Response: The Department modified the final rule to reflect this \nsuggested language.\n    2. Comment: One commenter, pointing to proposed changes to Sec.  \n96.45(b)(9), is concerned the changes would expose a supervised \nprovider in the United States to requests for information from \naccrediting entities with no jurisdiction over the accreditation or \napproval of the primary provider. Such inquiries would be burdensome \nand lack authority.\n    Response: In response to this comment, the Department is adding \nclarifying information about a requesting accrediting entity's \njurisdiction. With more than one accrediting entity, an accrediting \nentity could be responsible for monitoring and oversight of a primary \nprovider, even though it was not the accrediting entity to issue the \nprimary provider's accreditation or approval. The final rule reflects \nthis requirement for supervised providers to respond to an accrediting \nentity's request for information. However, we have modified the rule to \nadd ``. . .  or an accrediting entity with jurisdiction over the \nprimary provider'' to Sec.  96.45(b)(9) to clarify that the requesting \naccrediting entity must have jurisdiction over the primary provider.\nSection 96.46 Using Providers in Foreign Countries\n    1. Comment: Commenters remarked that the proposed rule stated the \nDepartment would not propose changes to the regulations relating to \nforeign supervised providers but in fact made a few changes to Sec.  \n96.46.\n    Response: The Department noted in its preamble to the proposed rule \n\\3\\ that it was not addressing regulatory changes to accreditation \nstandards relating to foreign supervised providers. Instead, the \npreamble pointed to a consultative process with stakeholders to address \na wide range of related standards. Most of the changes introduced in \nthe proposed rule in Sec.  96.46 were minor corrections or \nclarifications. The one substantive change in this section, found in \nSec.  96.46(b)(7) and (8), requires the primary provider to include in \nthe agreement with foreign supervised providers that the foreign \nsupervised provider's fees and expenses will be billed to and paid by \nthe client(s) through the primary provider. This change prohibits \nforeign supervised providers from requiring direct payments for \nadoption services abroad from prospective adoptive parents, which would \nexpose them to potential abuses such as overcharging.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ 85 FR 74497, November 20, 2020.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    2. Comment: A commenter points out the benefit of requiring all \nforeign fees to be paid through the primary provider to mitigate the \npotential for fraud and illicit financial practices, but also notes the \nneed to preserve provisions lost to the removal of Sec.  96.46(b)(8), \nprovisions for refundability of fees paid overseas.\n    Response: The Department included in the final rule a provision in \nSec.  96.46(b)(7) requiring the primary provider to provide a written \nexplanation of how and when such fees and expenses will be refunded if \nthe service is not provided or completed and will return any funds \ncollected to which the client(s) may be entitled within sixty days of \nthe completion of the delivery of services.\n    3. Comment: Several commenters recommend removing the new \nprovisions in Sec.  96.46(b)(7). They think requiring primary providers \nto bill prospective adoptive parents for and pay fees directly to \nforeign supervised providers is inefficient and would unnecessarily add \nadministrative costs to prospective adoptive parents for making wire \ntransfers on their behalf. The commenters observe this would limit \nfamilies using other payment options open to them such as domestic wire \ntransfers or domestic checking. These commenters recommend allowing \nprospective adoptive families to take care of their own wire transfers \nto pay for fees in country, including those due to foreign supervised \nproviders. Other commenters question the stated premise on which the \nchange was based, namely\n\n[[Page 57249]]\n\nthat it was meant to protect adoptive families from transporting large \nsums of cash to countries of origin. These commenters argue that \ntransporting cash to is no longer standard practice and that adoptive \nfamilies typically use bank wire transfers instead.\n    Response: The Department retained the changes in Sec.  96.46(b)(7) \nin the final rule. This standard applies only to fees and expenses \nrelated to providing adoption services. These services are enumerated \nin the supervisory agreement between the primary provider and the \nforeign supervisor, pursuant to Sec.  96.46(b)(1). Fees and expenses \nfor other services in the country of origin may be paid for directly by \nprospective adoptive parents. The elements in this standard reinforce \nin an important way the supervisory relationship between primary \nproviders and foreign supervised providers as they require active \nprimary provider oversight of the receipt and expenditure of funds \nrelating to adoption services provided abroad.\nStandards for Cases in Which a Child Is Immigrating to the United \nStates (Incoming Cases)\nSection 96.47 Preparation of Home Studies in Incoming Cases\n    1. Comment: A commenter recommends deleting ``counseling'' from \nSec.  96.47(a)(3). The commenter thinks this change would bring Sec.  \n96.47(a)(3) into closer alignment with 8 CFR 204.311(c)(5), (c)(8), \n(c)(9), and (g)(4).\n    Response: In response to this comment, the Department revised Sec.  \n96.47(a)(3) to include the language ``preparation'' in addition to \n``counseling'' and ``training.'' Counseling, where indicated, may \ninform the home study, whether provided by a home study preparer \nlicensed to provided formal counseling, or when the family is referred \nto a different professional licensed to provide it. Preparation would \ninclude a wide variety of work provided by the home study preparer \nshort of formal counseling for which a separate license would be \nrequired.\n    2. Comment: Several commenters are concerned about the requirement \nin Sec.  96.47(e)(1) to inform the prospective adoptive parent(s) prior \nto USCIS if the agency or person withdraws its recommendation of the \nprospective adoptive parent(s) for adoption. In their view, to provide \nfor the child's safety, it may be in the best interests of the child to \nnotify USCIS first.\n    Response: The Department made no revisions to the order in which \nagencies and persons must notify prospective adoptive families and \nUSCIS of their withdrawal of a recommendation in favor of the family \nadopting. We did add the primary provider as an additional entity to \nnotify, if appropriate. The notification requirements in Sec.  \n96.47(b)(1) and (2) allow expeditious notification of prospective \nadoptive parents and USCIS. An agency or person is not required to wait \nfive business days to provide adoptive families with written notice of \nthe withdrawal, just that it do so within five business days of its \ndecision to withdraw. Likewise, the regulation does not insist that an \nagency or person wait five days before notifying USCIS. In practical \nterms, once the agency or person decides to withdraw its recommendation \nof the family to adopt, it can notify the family in writing immediately \nfollowing the decision and can notify USCIS in writing immediately \nthereafter, causing no delay that would be contrary to the best \ninterests of the child.\n    3. Comment: A commenter is concerned that Sec.  96.47(e) is unclear \nas to what involvement and responsibilities a primary provider would \nhave if it was not the entity that conducted or approved the home \nstudy.\n    Response: The Department is revising Sec.  96.47(e) to include \nnotification of the primary provider in the case. Because the primary \nprovider as identified in Sec.  96.14 is responsible for ensuring the \nsix adoption services are provided in an intercountry adoption case as \nprovided in Sec.  96.44, notification is essential to its ability to \nperform its overarching function in the case. We also revised Sec.  \n96.47(e)(1) in the final rule to require the agency or person, if \napplicable, to make reasonable efforts to also notify the primary \nprovider of its withdrawal of any approval of the home study.\n    4. Comment: Many commenters recommend the Department remove ``good \ncause'' from Sec.  96.47(e)(3).\n    Response: The Department removed the reference to ``good cause'' \nfrom the final rule and revised Sec.  96.47(e)(3) to require that an \nagency or person maintain written records of the withdrawal of its \nrecommendation and/or approval, the step(s) taken prior to reaching \nsuch a decision, and the reasons for the withdrawal.\n    5. Comment: Several commenters believe the proposed language in the \nproposed Sec.  96.47(e)(4) and (5) is repetitive of other provisions \napplicable to home studies and should be omitted.\n    Response: The Department removed Sec.  96.47(e)(4) and (5) from the \nfinal rule in response to these comments.\nSection 96.49 Provision of Medical and Social Information in Incoming \nCases\n    1. Comment: A commenter requests the Department revise the \nreference to videotape and photograph to video and photo to make it \nclear the standard also includes digital videos and photographs.\n    Response: The Department replaced all references to the term \n``videotape'' with the term ``video'' in Sec.  96.49 in the final rule \nbut did not revise the term ``photographs.'' The Department believes \nthe term ``photographs'' is inclusive of photographs taken with film or \ndigitally.\nSec.  96.51 Post-Adoption Services in Incoming Cases\n    1. Comment: Several commenters are concerned that a dissolution \ncould occur years after the adoption is finalized and any cost schedule \nwould be obsolete. In addition, there are concerns this regulation \nwould force ASPs to be experts in the laws of all 50 states where a \ndissolution could take place.\n    Response: The Department did not retain a requirement to provide \nthe cost for post-adoption services for all agencies and persons. The \nrule requires agencies and persons to inform prospective adoptive \nparents whether post-adoption services will be provided. Section 96.40 \nrequires agencies and persons, before providing any adoption services, \nto provide expected total fees and expenses for post-placement and \npost-adoption reports. The Department encourages agencies and approved \nproviders to assist adoptive families by providing post-adoption \nservices where possible. Section 96.51(c) requires agencies and persons \nto provide post-adoption reporting in the adoption services contract if \nsuch reporting is required by a child's country of origin.\nSection 96.52 Performance of Communication and Coordination Functions \nin Incoming Cases\n    1. Comment: Several commenters note the proposed changes in Sec.  \n96.52(a)(1) would significantly increase reporting requirements for \nagencies and persons and that the new reporting requirements to U.S. \nand foreign Central Authorities are either already part of other \nreporting standards or not required by foreign authorities.\n    Response: In response to the comments about the proposed changes to \nSec.  96.52(a)(1), the final rule reflects removal of the proposed new \nrequirements in Sec.  96.52(a)(1).\n    2. Comment: One commenter notes the addition of ``including any \nupdates\n\n[[Page 57250]]\n\nand amendments'' to Sec.  96.52(b)(1) should be further clarified by \nadding ``when requested or required'' by the relevant Central \nAuthority. The commenter is concerned that if the Central Authority \ndoes not require such updates, the additional information could \noverwhelm Central Authorities and add costs for clients if the updates \nor amendments require translation.\n    Response: In response to this comment, the Department revised Sec.  \n96.52(b)(1) to include ``any updates required by such competent \nauthorities in the child's country of origin.'' Agencies and persons \nmust provide Central Authorities with the most up-to-date suitability \ninformation on the prospective adoptive parent(s).\n    3. Comment: One commenter notes the requirements under Sec.  \n96.52(b)(4) is an action performed by the Department, not the agency or \nperson, and should be deleted.\n    Response: The Department did not delete this section. Section \n96.52(b) retains the flexibility of the phrase ``the agency or person \ntakes all appropriate measures, consistent with the procedures of the \nU.S. Central Authority and the foreign country.'' The Department has \nrevised the final rule to clarify that this action could be to \n``confirm that this information has been transmitted to the foreign \ncountry's Central Authority or other competent authority by the U.S. \nCentral Authority.'' Providing this communication and coordination is \nimportant to ensuring that the Convention process is followed and to \navoid unnecessary delays in the process.\n    4. Comment: One commenter observes that the requirement of Sec.  \n96.52(d) is about an outdated practice related to the cost of replacing \nhard copies of home studies. The commenter notes this requirement of \nreturning an original home study and/or the original child background \nstudy to the authorities that forwarded them is unnecessary.\n    Response: The Department revised this standard in the final rule \nrelying on agencies and persons to determine the appropriate course of \naction for disposition of case documents in the event the transfer of \nthe child does not take place. Factors to consider include but are not \nlimited to, the specific requirements, if any, of competent authorities \nin either the State or in the receiving country and the preference of \nprospective adoptive parent(s) to continue pursuing an adoption.\n    5. Comment: One commenter notes Sec.  96.52(e) is overly broad and \nthat a violation of any standard in Subpart F would also include a \nviolation of Sec.  96.52(e).\n    Response: We have made no changes in the final rule in response to \nthis comment about section 96.52(e). This final rule clarifies that the \nobligation in Sec.  96.52(e) only applies to requirements that the \nSecretary has identified under existing authorities and made known \n(directly or via an accrediting entity) to agencies and persons.\nStandards for Cases in Which a Child is Emigrating From the United \nStates\nSection 96.55 Performance of Convention Communication and Coordination \nFunctions on Outgoing Convention Cases\n    1. Comment: One commenter is concerned that in Sec.  96.55(c) the \nuse of the word ``original'' in this context is outdated and asks why \nthis standard only applies to the home study and child study and not \nother documents.\n    Response: The requirement in Sec.  96.55(c) derives from Article \n19(3) of the Convention, which provides that: ``If the transfer of the \nchild does not take place, the reports referred to in Articles 15 (home \nstudy of prospective adoptive parents) and 16 (child background study) \nare to be sent back to the authorities who forwarded them.'' The final \nrule allows accredited agencies and approved persons to meet this \nConvention obligation by considering the specific requirements, if any, \nof competent authorities in either the U.S. State or in the receiving \ncountry and the preference of prospective adoptive parent(s).\n\nSubpart L--Oversight of Accredited Agencies and Approved Persons by the \nSecretary\n\nSection 96.83 Suspension or Cancellation of Accreditation or Approval \nby the Secretary\n    1. Comment: Several commenters note their support of the due \nprocess elements of the revisions in Sec.  96.83(b) governing \nsuspension and cancellation of accreditation by the Secretary and \nrequested the same due process be given to agencies and persons when an \naccrediting entity imposes adverse action.\n    Response: The Department made no changes to the regulations in \nresponse to these comments. The circumstances associated with \nsuspensions and cancellations by the Secretary under Sec.  96.83 are \nmore likely to involve complex fact patterns and emergent situations \nthan the broader range of adverse actions imposed by an accrediting \nentity pursuant to subpart K. The revisions to Sec.  96.83(b) include \nmore detailed notice provisions warranted by the circumstances in such \ncases.\n    2. Comment: Commenters point out as written, Sec.  96.83(c) \nmandates notification to entities including the Hague Permanent Bureau, \nState licensing authorities, Central Authorities where the agency or \nperson operates, and other authorities as appropriate, of the \nSecretary's decision to suspend or cancel accreditation, seemingly \nbefore that decision has become final. Commenters request that the \nSec.  96.83(c) notifications occur only after the disclosures made to \nthe agency or person at the time of the Secretary's written notice of \nits decision to suspend or cancel and after the process in Sec.  \n96.84(a) and (b) permitting rebuttal of the decision on the facts.\n    Response: The Department made no changes to Sec.  96.83(a) \nrequiring the Secretary to suspend or cancel the accreditation or \napproval when s/he finds the agency or person is substantially out of \ncompliance with the standards in subpart F, nor to notification of \nsuspension or cancellation pursuant to Sec.  96.83(c). There is no \nexpectation of delay of the effect of suspension or cancellation and no \nprovision similar to Sec.  96.77(a) by which the Secretary could delay \nthe effect of suspension or cancellation. Furthermore, the provisions \nin Sec.  96.84 allowing for withdrawal of suspension or cancellation by \nthe Secretary assume the suspension or cancellation has already been \nnotified pursuant to Sec.  96.83(c) and provides for notification to \nthe same authorities of the withdrawal.\nSection 96.88 Procedures for Debarment With Prior Notice\n    1. Comment: Commenters request that in the proposed Sec.  96.88(a), \nthe Department provide additional information on the rationale for \nstandard-specific non-compliance determinations.\n    Response: The Department made no changes in response to these \ncomments. The rationale for standard-specific non-compliance is \ndemonstrated through conduct-specific information provided pursuant to \nSec.  96.88(a)(2). The two sections 96.88(a)(2) and 96.88(a)(3), in \nconjunction, will provide sufficient notice to agencies and persons to \nprovide transparency and clarity to the adverse action notification \nprocess.\n    2. Comment: Several commenters are concerned the time allotted for \nthe Department to respond to an agency's response to a notice of \ndebarment hearing in the proposed Sec.  96.88(b) and (c) precludes the \nagency or person from a meaningful response and allows the Department \nto gather additional or different evidence than was originally\n\n[[Page 57251]]\n\nrelied upon without the agency having a similar opportunity. Similarly, \ncommenters wonder why agencies and persons would not be entitled to \nconduct discovery.\n    Response: The Department made no changes in response to this \ncomment. As noted in the proposed Sec.  96.88(c)(5), the procedures for \ndebarment in Sec.  96.88 are informal and permissive; the hearing \nofficer may accommodate reasonable variations in the process. \nInformation developed from all sources becomes part of the record and \nis available to all parties. Although there is no right to subpoena \nwitnesses or conduct discovery, the agency or person may testify in \nperson, offer evidence on its own behalf, present witnesses, and make \narguments at the hearing. Taken together, these features offer a sound \nbasis for an effective and fair proceeding.\n    3. Comment: One commenter is concerned that the Department, while \npermitting agencies to provide witnesses, may undermine that right by \ndenying a visa to a foreign citizen willing to testify.\n    Response: The Department has included the option for testifying via \nteleconference or to accept an affidavit or sworn deposition testimony \nat the discretion of the hearing officer if any witness is unable to \nappear. Obtaining a visa to appear in person should not prevent a \nwitness in a foreign country from providing testimony in a debarment \nhearing. All testimony becomes part of the written record, the only \nrecord to be reviewed by the Secretary to make a debarment decision.\n    4. Comment: Citing the intent of Congress as stated in Senate \nReport 106-276 that the Secretary may take enforcement actions only \nafter the established avenue of enforcement by the accrediting entity \nhas been found wanting, one commenter recommends that any written \nnotice of a debarment hearing explain why the accrediting entity with \njurisdiction is not taking action in the case.\n    Response: The Department made no change to the regulation in \nresponse to this comment and notes that the cited Senate Report \ncomments on the Secretary's authority in IAA Section 204(b) to suspend \nor cancel accreditation decisions by accrediting entities. The \nprocedures in Sec.  96.88 relate to IAA Section 204(c) Debarment. \nDebarment is an exceptional proceeding outside of other enforcement \nactions established by the IAA, justified by circumstances that warrant \nexceptional action, i.e., when ``there has been a pattern of serious, \nwillful, or grossly negligent failures to comply or other aggravating \ncircumstances indicating that continued accreditation or approval would \nnot be in the best interests of the children and families concerned.'' \nIAA Section 204(c)(1)(B), (42 U.S.C. 14924(c)(1)(B)). In this \nsituation, the Congress provided authority for the Secretary to \ninstitute debarment proceedings on the Secretary's own initiative and \nindependent of action by an accrediting entity, though an accrediting \nentity may request or recommend the Secretary debar an agency or \nperson.\nSection 96.90 Review of Suspension, Cancellation, or Debarment by the \nSecretary\n    1. Technical Correction: The Department addresses in Sec.  96.90(b) \njudicial review of final decisions by the Secretary pursuant to IAA \nSection 204(d) (42 U.S.C. 14924(d)). We erroneously stated in our \nproposed rule that if the petition to Federal Court raises an issue \n``whether the deficiencies necessitating a suspension or cancellation \nhave been corrected,'' the agency or person must first exhaust the \nprocedures pursuant to Sec.  96.84(b). The referenced procedures are \nfound instead in Sec.  96.84(c). We made this correction in the final \nrule.\n    2. Comment: Several commenters are concerned with the provisions in \nSec.  96.90(b) requiring, under certain conditions, that agencies and \npersons exhaust the process in Sec.  96.84(c) before seeking judicial \nreview. The commenters think this requirement exceeds the Department's \nauthority to limit judicial review.\n    Response: The Department has made no changes to the provisions in \nSec.  96.90(b). IAA Section 204(b) (42 U.S.C. 14924(b)) provides for \nagencies or persons to petition a Federal Court to set aside the \nSecretary's final suspension, cancellation, and debarment decisions. \nSection 96.84(a)-(b) and Sec.  96.84(c) provide two distinct processes \nto seek the Secretary's review of their suspension and cancellation \ndecisions: Section 96.84(a)-(b) provides for a time-limited basis for \nfiling with the Secretary a statement along with supporting materials \nas to why the decision was unwarranted and an internal review on the \nmerits. Section 96.90(b) also denotes at what point a decision becomes \nfinal and thus reviewable in Federal Court. Section 96.84(c) is \ndifferent in character from and operates independently of questions of \n``unwarrantedness.'' Section 96.84(c) executes the Secretary's \nauthority in IAA Section 204(b)(2) (42 U.S.C. 14924(b)(2)) to terminate \na suspension or permit reapplication in the case of cancellation, ``at \nany time when the Secretary is satisfied that the deficiencies on the \nbasis of which adverse action is taken under paragraph 1 have been \ncorrected. . . .'' Petitions under this section may be made regardless \nof whether the Secretary has made a final decision of suspension or \ncancellation pursuant to Sec.  96.84(a) and (b) and IAA Section 204(d) \n(42 U.S.C. 14924(d)). Far from limiting an agency or person's right to \njudicial review in such instances, Sec.  96.90(b) streamlines that \nreview process by allowing the Secretary to resolve first the issue the \nIAA assigns her/him to resolve. The decision to terminate suspension or \ncancellation pursuant to Sec.  96.84(c) is not a final decision subject \nto judicial review pursuant to IAA Section 204(d).\n\nSubpart M--Disseminating and Reporting of Information by the \nAccrediting Entities\n\nSection 96.92 Dissemination of Information to the Public About \nAccreditation and Approval Status\n    1. Comment: One commenter thinks the proposed deletion of Sec.  \n96.92(b) will weaken the requirement for an accrediting entity to make \ninformation available to the public about an agency or person's \naccreditation and approval status. However, the commenter also notes \nthe revision to Sec.  96.92(a) will require an accrediting entity to \nmake information available more regularly than the current quarterly \nrequirement.\n    Response: Subpart M is intended to help prospective adoptive \nparent(s) make informed decisions about accredited agencies and \napproved persons. The final rule requires an accrediting entity to \nprovide information about agency and person activities in Sec.  \n96.92(a) more frequently, at least monthly rather than quarterly. The \nfinal rule retains Sec.  96.92(b), formerly Sec.  96.91(b), in order to \nmaintain the requirement for an accrediting entity to provide such \ninformation upon specific request to individual members of the public. \nThe final rule retains the addition of ``including, where relevant, the \nidentity and conduct of any foreign supervised provider'' to assist \nprospective adoptive parents to make more informed decisions about the \nselection of an agency or person.\n\nSubpart R--Alternative Procedures for Primary Providers in Intercountry \nAdoption by Relatives\n\nSec.  96.100 Alternative Procedures for Primary Providers in \nIntercountry Adoption by Relatives\n    1. Comment: Several commenters welcome the effort to provide\n\n[[Page 57252]]\n\nregulations relating to adoption by relatives. Others expressed \nreservations that the proposed regulation will not produce the \nanticipated result of streamlining the process.\n    Response: The Department made no changes to the proposed \nregulations in Subpart R except for withdrawing Sec.  96.100(d) and \nrenumbering Section 96.100(e) to become the new Sec.  96.100(d). We \nagree with one commenter's statement that the relative adoption \nregulations balance services provided by close family members and \nservices for which the primary provider is responsible. By limiting the \nrequired number of adoption services the primary provider must provide, \nthe agencies or person's time commitment to such cases may be reduced, \nwhich is likely to reduce the cost of the services they provide in such \ncases.\n    2. Comment: Some commenters are concerned the new provisions are \nnot sufficient to overcome the perceived risks to families and to \nagencies and persons for providing limited adoption services in \nrelative cases. These commenters noted that providing adoption services \n5 (post-placement monitoring) and 6 (disruption before final adoption) \nfrom the United States is difficult and it is unrealistic to expect an \nagency or person would have the capacity, knowledge, or relationships \nto effectively monitor a placement or be able to support the parties \ninvolved in a disrupted placement.\n    Response: As envisioned by the IAA, adoption services 5 and 6 are \nimportant pieces of the regulatory process to protect the interests of \nchildren, birth parents, and prospective adoptive parents in \nintercountry adoption cases. Protecting those interests is no less a \nfeature in the alternative procedures for intercountry adoption by \nrelatives, and the final rule reflects this reality. Circumstances in \neach adoption case may vary and demand the primary provider's judgment \nand expertise with post-placement monitoring and transfer of the child \nto the custody of the adoptive family.\n    3. Comment: Several commenters point out the importance of training \nfor prospective adoptive parent(s) in relative adoption cases but note \nthe training elements in Sec.  96.48 were not tailored to prepare \nadoptive families for adoption by relatives.\n    Response: The Department made no changes to Sec.  96.48 \n(preparation and training for prospective adoptive parents) in the \nfinal rule with respect to adoption by relatives. We agree prospective \nadoptive parent(s) adopting relatives will benefit from pre-adoptive \ntraining and preparation and that some parts of the training outlined \nin Sec.  96.48 may be more relevant to the relative adoption context \nthan others. See the plans for review of Sec.  96.48 in paragraph II.E. \nof this preamble.\n\nIV. Timeline for Implementing Changes in the Final Rule\n\n    All changes in the final rule, including those related to the new \nalternative procedures for adoption by relatives abroad in subpart R, \nbecome effective 180 days after publication of the final rule in the \nFederal Register.\n\nV. Regulatory Analysis\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA)\n\n    Consistent with the requirements in Section 203 of the Intercountry \nAdoption Act, as amended, the Department is issuing this final rule \nafter having provided a period of public notice and comment on the rule \nin an NPRM published November 20, 2020.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    This section considers the cost to small business entities of the \nchanges to the accreditation regulations in this final rule as required \nby the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, 5 U.S.C. et seq., Pub. L. 96-\n354) as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct of 1996 (SBREFA). The RFA generally requires an agency to prepare a \nregulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and \ncomment rulemaking requirements under 5 U.S.C. 553(b). The IAA in \nsection 203(a)(3) (42 U.S.C. 14923(a)(3)) provides that subsections \n(b), (c), and (d) of 5 U.S.C. 553 apply to this rulemaking. Consistent \nwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we prepared a final regulatory \nflexibility analysis, which requires the following elements:\n(1) A Statement About the Need for and Objectives of the Rule\n    We refer the reader to the supplemental information on the final \nrule at the top of this preamble, which summarizes what we set out to \naccomplish in this final rule.\n\n(2) A Statement of the Significant Issues Raised by the Public Comments \nin Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA), a \nStatement of the Assessment of the Agency of Such Issues, and a \nStatement of any Changes Made in the Proposed Rule as a Result of Such \nComments\n\n    The public comments addressed the content of our IRFA, both in \ngeneral terms and in comments directed to specific proposed changes. \nSome commenters were concerned that the cumulative impact of the \nproposed changes to our accreditation rule would result in increased \ncosts to agencies and to fees charged to families. This was the most \nconsistent concern. Some commenters thought that our estimated costs of \nimplementation were low or did not consider some of the tasks they felt \nwere essential to implementing the proposed changes. Of the \nDepartment's roughly 170 proposed edits and substantive changes to the \naccreditation rule, nearly half received no public comments. For the \nmost part, these were minor edits or corrections to the regulation \ntext, with no impact on the cost of implementation. We incorporated \nthese changes into the final rule.\n    For the proposed changes about which stakeholders provided \ncomments, we evaluated them first on the basis of substance, i.e., what \nwas the commenter trying to communicate about the proposed rule, and \nhow did that align with our underlying statute, the IAA, and the \nConvention? Did the commenter propose a change we had not previously \nconsidered? How did the proposed change impact other parts of the \nregulations?\n    Subsequent to these considerations on substance we considered the \ncost to agencies and persons of implementing the commenter-proposed \nregulatory changes: If a proposed change was incremental, was the cost \nto implement also small? Or would a proposed change increase \nimplementation costs but significantly enhance the regulation's ability \nto promote the child and family protection objectives of the IAA and \nthe Convention? These inquiries helped us balance the impact of \ncommenter-proposed changes on substance and costs in our final rule. \nThe section-by-section discussion of significant comments in preamble \nsection III demonstrates this analytical approach.\n    Significant Comments: Here are a few examples of significant public \ncomments by commenters seeking relief from changes to the accreditation \nregulations they found too costly, too burdensome to implement.\n(a) Standards Related to Adoption Placement Disruption Reporting\n    In section 96.50, which deals with agency and person \nresponsibilities when a placement disrupts prior to the final adoption, \nour proposed changes strengthened standards for agency or person action \nwhen a disruption occurs.\n    Commenters recommended reducing or eliminating many of the changes, \nwhich they found overly burdensome to implement. Our policy priority \nremains to enhance protection of children who\n\n[[Page 57253]]\n\nare the most vulnerable when a disruption occurs. We believe it may be \npossible to develop a more streamlined standard on disruption reporting \nthat minimizes costs while enhancing protection for children in these \ncases. We withdrew proposed changes to Sec.  96.50 to gain a better \nunderstanding of stakeholder perspectives through consultation before \nproposing changes relating to disruption reporting.\n(b) Standards Relating to Making Direct Payments to Orphanages or Other \nEntities for Children Pending Adoption\n    In the proposed rule in section 96.36 (a), we prohibited direct \npayments to birth parents, individuals, orphanages, or other \ninstitutions for the benefit of specific children and birth parents. \nDirect support payments by adoption service providers, their employees, \nand agents for specific child welfare activities, if permitted by the \ncountry of origin, has long been the subject of deep controversy among \ninternational child welfare and adoption experts. Our challenge is to \nsufficiently regulate the financial aspects of intercountry adoption to \nbest mitigate the risk of these payments being diverted to support \nillicit practices directly or indirectly. Illicit practices we seek to \navoid include, among others, recruiting children into institutions or \nchild buying for purposes of intercountry adoption, or incentivizing \ninstitutions to retain children longer than necessary. Commenters \nargued strongly that this approach would be prejudicial to the best \ninterests and wellbeing of children and noted in particular the \nimportance of supporting children with medical conditions that require \nimmediate attention that might not otherwise be possible without direct \nfinancial support. We found these arguments to be persuasive but remain \ndeeply concerned about the possible diversion of these funds to illicit \npractices, which threaten the viability of intercountry adoption as a \nwhole in addition to putting at risk the best interests and wellbeing \nof children. Our solution was to withdraw the prohibitions against \nmaking payments for child welfare and child protective services, while \nat the same time enhancing the standards for recordkeeping to increase \noversight of the use of those funds. On balance, we wanted to respect \nthe views of commenters about the value of providing targeted funds for \nchild welfare and protective services in the period between matching \nand adoption, while imposing effective controls tracking the use of \nthose funds.\n(c) Standards Relating to Disclosure of Fees To Be Paid by Prospective \nAdoptive Parents\n    We decided to withdraw, pending further stakeholder consultation, \nproposed changes in section 96.40 that would broadly restructure the \nway adoption service providers report fees to the public. The public \ncomments argued strongly not to implement these changes because of the \nhigh cost associated with implementation. Many commenters thought the \nnew structure did not adequately represent the way adoption service \nproviders categorize fees and estimated expenses for prospective \nadoptive parent(s), nor did it address practical barriers to \nimplementing the new structure. We believe strongly in achieving \ngreater transparency in adoption service provider fees while taking \nseriously concerns that the cost of implementation would be higher than \nwe had assessed. This is another area in which we believe additional \nstakeholder consultations are required to identify viable solutions \nbefore moving forward with any changes to the regulations.\n(3) A Description of the Comments Filed by SBA\n    The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration \ndid not provide comments to our proposed rule.\n(4) A Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which \nthe Rule Will Apply\n    Table 1 summarizes the number of adoption service providers \naccredited or approved to provide adoption services in intercountry \nadoption cases. As of July 2022, there were 84 accredited or approved \nfirms. Of those firms, 72 are small business entities according to the \ndefinition of the North American Industry Classification System \n(NAICS), which the SBA relies on to define small business firms. \nDifferent industries define small business firms differently. NAICS \nCode 624110 is the industry code for Child and Youth Services and \nincludes establishments such as adoption agencies or entities that \nprovide child adoption services. NAICS code 624110 defines small firms \nas those with gross revenues of up to $15.5 million. We established \nagency and person annual gross revenues or receipts from their public \nfilings of IRS form 990. Six firms are not small business entities \nbecause their annual gross receipts exceeded $15.5 million. For six \nadoption service providers we have no gross receipts data (a small \nnumber of firms are not required to file form 990). Table 1 shows the \ndistribution of gross receipts for the remaining 72 small firms.\n\n  Table 1--U.S. Accredited and Approved Adoption Service Provider Firms\n      Grouped by Annual Gross Receipts, NAICS Industry Code 624110\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Number of\n  Firms grouped by self-reported gross       adoption      Percentage of\n                receipts                      service       small firms\n                                             providers\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther Firms:\n    Firms with Gross Receipts over                     6             N/A\n     $15.5M.............................\nAll Small Firms:\n    Small Firms with Gross Receipts up                72            100%\n     to $15.5M..........................\n    Firms with Gross Receipts over $5M                 7             10%\n     and up to $15.5M...................\n    Firms with Gross Receiptsover $2M                 12             17%\n     and up to $5M......................\n    Firms with Gross Receiptsover $1M                 11             15%\n     and up to $2M......................\n    Firms with Gross Receiptsover $500K               14             19%\n     and up to $1M......................\n    Firms with Gross Receiptsover $0 and              28             39%\n     up to $500K........................\nFirms for Which We Have No Financial                   6             N/A\n Data...................................\n    Total Number of U.S.Accredited and                84             N/A\n     Approved Adoption Service Providers\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page 57254]]\n\n(5) A Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other \nCompliance Requirements of the Rule, Including Estimation of the \nClasses of Small Business Entities That Will Be Subject to the \nRequirements and the Types of Skills Necessary for Preparation of the \nReport or Record\n    Several of the new provisions in the final rule require additional \nrecord-keeping or reporting. The skills needed to perform the \nrecordkeeping and reporting aspects of these changes to the regulation \ninclude planning for the form such recordkeeping will take, tracking of \nfunds possibly provided using Excel or similar spreadsheet software, \ncollecting information in a word processing document in some cases, and \nplanning for receipt and review of reporting. Examples of increased \nrecordkeeping and reporting:\n    <bullet> Proposed changes to section 96.32 include a new \nrequirement for agencies and persons to disclose to the accrediting \nentities business relationships with organizations having interlocking \nleadership or whose leaders share family relationships. This \nrequirement will apply to all agencies or persons, regardless of size. \nThe standard will require ASPs to maintain lists and to report them to \nthe accrediting entities. It will also require keeping the lists \nupdated, which will result in some, though modest, ongoing \nimplementation costs, after the first year.\n    <bullet> Section 96.36 concerns the prohibition on child buying and \ninducement. As discussed above, this final rule does not contain the \nprohibition on certain reasonable payments proposed in the NPRM. At the \nsame time, we introduced greater accountability for all payments \nthrough record-keeping requirements for payments made or fees paid in \nconnection with an intercountry adoption. Accounting for such payments \nwill help decrease the risk of payments intended to benefit children \nbeing diverted to support illicit practices. The record-keeping \nrequirements mentioned here apply to agency and person employees and \nsupervised providers who must retain a record of all payments provided \nin connection with an intercountry adoption and the purposes for which \nthey were paid.\n    <bullet> Changes to section 96.46 provide that fees and expenses \npaid to foreign supervised providers for adoption services abroad will \nbe billed to and paid by adoptive families through the primary \nprovider. This new requirement will mean agencies and persons will \ntransfer some funds to foreign supervised providers that families may \nhave been providing themselves. Agencies and persons already have \nstrong oversight responsibilities and supervision requirements with \nrespect to foreign supervised providers, which are reinforced by these \nchanges. The primary provider in the case is obliged under these \nchanges to provide a written explanation of how and when such fees and \nexpenses will be refunded if not used for the purpose intended. This \nprocess will require greater awareness and accountability on the part \nof the primary provider regarding how funds provided for use abroad are \ndispersed and accounted for.\n    <bullet> In some cases, an agency or person becomes aware of new \ninformation related to suitability and may withdraw its recommendation \nof the prospective adoptive parents in the home study or approval of a \nhome study. When this occurs, the new provisions in section 96.47(e) \nrequire the agency or person to notify appropriate parties, including \nUSCIS, the primary provider, and the prospective adoptive parents. \nThese disclosure requirements must be accomplished in a timely fashion. \nAll disclosures can be made electronically to facilitate the urgency of \nthe decision-making in the case and to limit the cost of disclosures.\n    <bullet> Finally, in section 96.51, which addresses post-adoption \nservices, including dissolution of an adoption, we included a new \nrequirement that agencies and persons that do not provide post-adoption \nservices provide clients information about potential sources of post-\nadoption support services where they live.\n(6) Description of the Steps the Agency Took To Minimize the \nSignificant Adverse Economic Impact on Small Entities, Organizations, \nor Small Government Jurisdictions\n    As noted, the Department diligently considered the concerns of \nagencies and persons about the cost of these changes to the \nregulations. The Department's primary concern was to meet the \nobligations of the statute on which the regulations are based and the \ntreaty obligations under the Convention. We undertook to balance those \ninterests with the practical realities of implementing changes to the \nregulations by the regulated entities. Part of this process was to try \nto determine what the cost of implementation would be. In our proposed \nrule, we provided the calculations we used to determine these costs, \nincluding the sources of information relating to national wage averages \nfor the various categories of work with appropriate skill sets. The \nDepartment relied on the extensive public record of regional and \nnational wage earner salaries found in Department of Labor \npublications. These data offered the most thoroughgoing estimates of \nwhat workers such as social workers, trainers, bookkeeping clerks, and \nauditors earn on average nationally, along with descriptions of what \nkinds of work they perform.\n    In Table 2, we summarize the implementation costs associated with \nsignificant changes found in the final rule. As noted before, we \nwithdrew some proposed changes and accepted some recommendations from \npublic commenters to alter other proposed changes, all of which had the \nresult of significantly reducing projected implementation costs of this \nfinal rule. We estimated average cost of implementing the proposed \nchanges in the proposed rule was over $14,000 for each small firm in \nthe first year. The current estimate for implementing the changes in \nthe final rule is just over $4,000 for a single firm in the first year.\n\n     Table 2--Projected Costs To Implement Changes in the Final Rule\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Projected Implementation Costs for Small Firms\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nA.

This rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of \n$100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or \nsignificant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, \nproductivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based companies to \ncompete with foreign-based companies in domestic and import markets.\n\nThe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (codified \nat 2 U.S.C. 1532) requires agencies to prepare a statement before \nproposing any rule that may result in an annual expenditure of $100 \nmillion or more by State, local, or tribal governments, or by the \nprivate sector. This rule will not result in any such expenditure, nor \nwill it significantly or uniquely affect small governments or the \nprivate sector.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132: Federalism\n\n    While States traditionally have regulated adoptions and will have \nan interest in this rule, the Department does not believe this \nregulation will have substantial direct effects on the States, on the \nrelationship between the national government and the States, or the \ndistribution of power and\n\n[[Page 57258]]\n\nresponsibilities among the various levels of government. The rule does \nnot impose any obligations on State governments or have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866, 14094, and 13563\n\n    The Department has reviewed this final rule to ensure its \nconsistency with the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in \nExecutive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Order 14094. The cost to \naccredited agencies and approved persons for implementing the changes \nin the final rule are modest and reflect an effort to maximize desired \noutcomes at minimized cost. The obligation to determine whether the \nbenefits of the proposed revision to the accreditation regulation \noutweigh the costs of achieving them is made more difficult by the fact \nthat the benefits, which primarily relate to protecting the best \ninterests of the child, as well as providing certain consumer \nprotections for prospective adoptive parents, are difficult to quantify \neconomically. That makes a strict cost-benefit analysis difficult to \naccomplish. Nonetheless, we believe the benefits apparent from this \nqualitative discussion of costs and benefits support our conclusion \nthat the costs associated with the proposed changes are justified and \nconclude they deliver significant benefits on several levels. The \nbenefits to children, to adoptive families, to society in general, and \nto the institution of intercountry adoption in terms of its world-wide \nviability, outweigh the dollar costs of implementing the proposed \nchanges.\n    We discussed earlier in this preamble why we pursued revisions to \nthe accreditation rule and why we introduced new elements. We noted \nqualitative factors informing the process and our estimates of average \ndollar costs to implement them. In parts II and III of this preamble, \nwe highlighted changes included in this final rule responsive to \nadoption service provider comments addressing both the cost and the \neffectiveness of our proposed revisions to the rule. The following \ndiscussion summarizes the categories of benefits driving changes \nincorporated in the final rule.\n    Because this final rule concerns standards for agencies and persons \nproviding adoption services in intercountry adoption and the \naccreditation and oversight process authorizing them to do so, our \ncost-benefit analysis relies on categories of benefits that are both \nnonmonetizable and nonquantifiable. The qualitative character of the \nresulting cost-benefit analysis closely reflects the qualitative \noutcomes essential to carrying out our statutory accreditation scheme \nin service of each side of the adoption triad: children, birth \nfamilies, and adoptive families.\n    As part of the cost-benefit analysis responsive to Executive Orders \n12866, as amended, and E.O. 13563 we weighed possible changes to the \nfinal rule against several categories of qualitative benefits \nsummarized in Table 4.\n\n                       Table 4--Benefit Categories\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBenefit Category 1--Efficiency.\nBenefit Category 2--Clarity and Transparency.\nBenefit Category 3--Payment Accountability.\nBenefit Category 4--Enhanced Expertise of Social Service Personnel.\nBenefit Category 5--Preserving Due Process Protections.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Benefit category 1--Efficiency. This category represents maximizing \nthe effective use of resources in a standard or process. The new \nprovisions relating to adoption by relatives are illustrative as they \nprovide a streamlined process limiting primary provider services while \nleveraging the experience of in-country relatives. The resulting \nsavings in time and expense promises to make adoption by relatives a \nmore accessible option for adoptive families.\n    Benefit Category 2--Clarity and Transparency. The revised \nregulations provide processes that address persistent questions raised \nby adoption service providers and accrediting entities, such as \nrequirements for notification regarding changes in prospective adoptive \nparent suitability. This benefit category is also embodied in the \nrevision to best interests of the child and in clarifying the \nrequirements of the submission of complaints to adoption service \nproviders.\n    Benefit Category 3--Payment Accountability. In the final rule we \nintroduce enhanced recordkeeping practices for payments and fees made \nin connection with an intercountry adoption. In addition, we added a \nstandard that prohibits foreign supervised providers from directly \nbilling prospective adoptive parents for the provision of adoption \nservices abroad. These changes will increase transparency between \nprimary providers and foreign supervised providers in a child's country \nof origin and better protect prospective adoptive parents from price \ngouging and from imposition of unexpected additional fees in the \nadoption process abroad.\n    Benefit Category 4--Enhanced Expertise of Social Service Personnel. \nWe enhanced social worker training standards to incorporate new \nelements relating to trauma-informed parenting and assisting children \nwith special needs. Agencies and persons utilize initial and ongoing \ntraining to keep newly hired and current employees well prepared and \nhighly knowledgeable. Duties assigned to social service personnel \ninclude providing adoptive families adoption-related social services \nthat involve the application of clinical skills and judgment.\n    Benefit Category 5--Preserving Due Process Protections. The \naccreditation regulations include procedures for holding agencies and \npersons accountable for misconduct through adverse action proceedings. \nIn the final rule we introduce new procedural safeguards applicable \nwhen the Secretary suspends or cancels accreditation or approval, \nincluding how to overcome the suspension or cancellation either because \nthe adverse action was unwarranted or because the deficiencies leading \nto suspension or cancellation have been corrected. These changes also \nenhance clarity and transparency for adoption service providers faced \nwith a loss of accreditation or approval. The new procedures for use in \ndebarment proceedings, likewise, provide clarity and transparency while \nalso effectively protecting the due process rights of agencies and \npersons accused of the most egregious abuses and facing the most severe \npenalties.\n    Taken as a whole, the changes in this final rule represent \nessential revisions to make the accreditation regulations more \neffective given the purposes of the Convention and implementing \nlegislation, noted above, working for the best interests of children \nand enhanced viability of intercountry adoption worldwide.\n\n[[Page 57259]]\n\nTotal Cost Estimates\n    Table 5 summarizes the financial impacts of the proposed rule. \nTotal monetized costs of the proposed rule include the aggregated \naverage cost of implementing the proposed changes to the accreditation \nrule summarized in Table 2. The 10-year discounted cost of the proposed \nrule in 2023 dollars would range from $953,000 to $994,000 (with three \nand seven percent discount rates, respectively). The annualized costs \nof the proposed rule would range from $95,000 to $99,000 (with three \nand seven percent discount rates, respectively).\n\nTable 5--Costs of the Proposed Rule in 2023 $ (Thousands) With Three and\n                      Seven Percent Discount Rates\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         All adoption\n                                                       service provider\n                     Fiscal year                       firms regardless\n                                                            of size\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2024................................................                 350\n2025................................................                  75\n2026................................................                  75\n2027................................................                  75\n2028................................................                  75\n2029................................................                  75\n2030................................................                  75\n2031................................................                  75\n2032................................................                  75\n2033................................................                  75\n                                                     -------------------\n    Undiscounted Total..............................              $1,025\n                                                     -------------------\n    Total with 3% discounting.......................                $994\n                                                     -------------------\n    Total with 7% discounting.......................                $953\n                                                     -------------------\n        Annualized, 3% discount rate, 10 years......                 $99\n                                                     -------------------\n        Annualized, 7% discount rate, 10 years......                 $95\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExecutive Order 12988: Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed these regulations in light of sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation risks, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburden.

The accrediting entity must advise \napplicants of the value assigned to each standard (or elements of each \nstandard) at the time it provides applicants with the application \nmaterials.\n    (e) If an agency or person previously has been denied accreditation \nor approval, has withdrawn its application in anticipation of denial, \nor is reapplying for accreditation or approval after cancellation, \nrefusal to renew, or temporary debarment, the accrediting entity must \ntake the reasons underlying such actions into account when evaluating \nthe agency or person for accreditation or approval, and may deny \naccreditation or approval on the basis of the previous action.\n    (f) If an agency or person that has an ownership or control \ninterest in the applicant, as that term is defined in section 1124 of \nthe Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-3), has been debarred pursuant \nto Sec.  96.85, the accrediting entity must take into account the \nreasons underlying the debarment when evaluating the agency or person \nfor accreditation or approval, and may deny accreditation or approval \nor refuse to\n\n[[Page 57265]]\n\nrenew accreditation or approval on the basis of the debarment.\n    (g) The standards contained in subpart F of this part do not \neliminate the need for an agency or person to comply fully with the \nlaws of jurisdictions in which it operates. An agency or person must \nprovide adoption services in intercountry adoption cases consistent \nwith the laws of any State in which it operates, and with the \nConvention, the IAA, and the UAA. Persons that are approved to provide \nadoption services may only provide such services in States that do not \nprohibit persons from providing adoption services. Nothing in the \napplication of this subpart E and subpart F of this part should be \nconstrued to require a State to allow persons to provide adoption \nservices if State law does not permit them to do so.\n\n\nSec.  96.28  [Reserved]\n\n0\n6.

For purposes of this paragraph:\n    (i) ``The children and families concerned'' include any children \nand any families whose interests have been or may be affected by the \nagency's or person's actions.\n    (ii) In determining whether the agency's or person's continued \naccreditation or approval would not be in the best interests of the \nchildren and families concerned, the Secretary may consider whether the \nagency's or person's continued accreditation would be detrimental to \nthe ability of U.S. citizens to adopt children through intercountry \nadoption in the future.\n    (3) A failure to comply with Sec.  96.47 (home study requirements) \nshall constitute a ``serious failure to comply'' unless it is shown by \nclear and convincing evidence that such noncompliance had neither the \npurpose nor the effect of determining the outcome of a decision or \nproceeding by a court or other competent authority in the United States \nor the child's country of origin; and\n    (i) Repeated serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to \ncomply with Sec.  96.47 (home study requirements) by an agency or \nperson after consultation between the Secretary and the accrediting \nentity with respect to previous noncompliance by such agency or person \nshall constitute a pattern of serious, willful, or grossly negligent \nfailures to comply.\n    (ii) [Reserved].\n    (c) The Secretary shall initiate a debarment proceeding by notice \nof proposed debarment, in accordance with the procedures in Sec.  \n96.88, unless the Secretary finds that it is necessary that debarment \nbe effective immediately because the agency's or person's continued \naccreditation would pose a substantial risk of significant harm to \nchildren or families. If the Secretary finds that it is necessary that \ndebarment be effective immediately, the procedures in Sec.  96.89 shall \ngovern such debarment.\n\n\nSec.  96.86   Length of debarment period and reapplication after \ntemporary debarment.\n\n    (a) In the case of a temporary debarment order, the order will take \neffect on the date specified in the order and will specify a date, not \nearlier than three years later, on or after which the agency or person \nmay petition the Secretary for withdrawal of the temporary debarment. \nIf the Secretary withdraws the temporary debarment, the agency or \nperson may then reapply for accreditation or approval to the same \naccrediting entity that handled its prior application for accreditation \nor approval. If that accrediting entity is no longer providing \naccreditation or approval services, the agency or person may apply to \nany accrediting entity with jurisdiction over its application.\n    (b) In the case of a permanent debarment order, the order will take \neffect on the date specified in the order. The agency or person will \nnot be permitted to apply again to an accrediting entity for \naccreditation or approval, or to the Secretary for termination of the \ndebarment.\n    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the \nSecretary from withdrawing a debarment if the Secretary concludes that \nthe action was based on a mistake of fact or was otherwise in error. \nUpon taking such action, the Secretary will take appropriate steps to \nnotify the accrediting entity(ies) and the entities referenced in Sec.  \n96.83(c).\n\n\nSec.  96.87   Responsibilities of the accredited agency, approved \nperson, and accrediting entity following suspension, cancellation, or \ndebarment by the Secretary.\n\n    If the Secretary suspends or cancels the accreditation or approval \nof an agency or person, or debars an agency or person, the agency or \nperson must cease to provide adoption services in all intercountry \nadoption cases.

In cases where the adoption or legal custody grant occurred \nprior to the primary provider's involvement in the case, the primary \nprovider must verify such training requirements have been met as soon \nas practicable.\n    (d) All services provided pursuant to this section must be \nperformed in accordance with the Convention, the IAA, the UAA, and the \nregulations implementing the IAA and the UAA.\n\n\nSec.  96.101   Effective date for alternative procedures for primary \nproviders in intercountry adoption by relatives.\n\n    The provisions of this subpart become effective January 8, 2025.\n    Note: The following appendix will not appear in the Code of Federal \nRegulations:\n\n   Appendix A--Relative Relationships as Defined in 8 CFR and 22 CFR--\n    Overlapping Familial Relationships in Two Definitions of Relative\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Column A                  Column B              Column C\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               Converted familial   Prospective adoptive\n Prospective adoptive parent    relationships in       parent familial\n familial relationships with      Column A for       relationships with\n the parent of the child to      comparison with       the child to be\n be adopted as defined in 8     relationships in     adopted as defined\n   CFR 204.309(b)(2)(iii)           Column C           in 22 CFR 96.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 To compare the         (Overlapping\n                                 relationships in    equivalent familial\n                               column A with those    relationships are\n                                 in column C, the         in bold.)\n                                 terms need to be\n                                 equivalent.

This final rule provides that private attorneys, interpreters, and other third parties may attend certain appointments at passport agencies and centers and at U.S. embassies and consulates overseas to assist the person requesting services (the applicant/requester). This rule permitting third-party attendance will apply only to appointments in support of an application for a U.S. passport, either domestically or overseas; to appointments related to a request for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad or a Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States (CLN); and to other appointments for certain other services offered by American Citizens Services (ACS) units at U.S. embassies and consulates overseas (posts).

    "supplementary_information": "The Department of State (Department) \npublished a proposed rule (Public Notice 11999) on July 26, 2023, at 88 \nFR 48143, with 60 days provided for public comment. This final rule \namends title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) by updating \nparts 50, 51, and 71 to publish regulations regarding when attorneys, \ninterpreters, or other third parties may attend an appointment either \ndomestically or overseas for a U.S. passport, Consular Report of Birth \nAbroad (CRBA), Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN) services, or \nfor certain other U.S citizen services offered by ACS units at post.\n    Additionally, the final rule includes technical amendments to 22 \nCFR part 71 to clarify that appropriately designated Department \nemployees, in addition to officers of the Foreign Service, may assist \nU.S. citizens seeking assistance at overseas posts. This change is \nconsistent with federal law and regulations which were amended after 22 \nCFR part 71 was established in 1957.\n\nAnalysis of Comments\n\n    The comment period for the proposed rule closed September 25, 2023, \nafter a 60-day comment period. Three comments were received. One \ncomment expressed unqualified support for the rule, noting that third-\nparty assistance at the applicant's expense is crucial to disabled \npersons, the elderly, children, and many other people requesting U.S. \ncitizens services. The other two comments also specifically expressed \nappreciation for the role that professional assistance of counsel may \nprovide. The comments raised the following topics:\n\nTopic 1: Qualifications of Attorney, Other Third-Party Attendee\n\n    Two commenters expressed concern that the draft rule does not \nspecify any qualifications that an attorney and/or other third party \nmust have as a prerequisite to attending covered appointments. In \nparticular, the commenters expressed concern about unauthorized \npractice of law.\n    The Department has previously considered whether to develop \nspecific requirements that an individual must meet (and presumably \nestablish to the satisfaction of the U.S. diplomatic or consular \nofficer) to qualify as an ``other third party'' with a view, in part, \nto protect against unauthorized practice of law by, e.g., non-attorney \nimmigration consultants. We have also considered whether to limit the \ndefinition of ``attorney'' to persons admitted to the bar of and \nlicensed to practice in a U.S. state who are in good standing. However, \nin promulgating this rule, the Department is not seeking to regulate \nthe person who a U.S. citizen chooses to accompany them to their \nappointment. While there is no Department-imposed requirement that an \napplicant/requester be represented\n\n[[Page 41309]]\n\nby an attorney or other third party (regardless of qualifications) to \napply for a U.S. passport, Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or any \nother covered service, the Department recognizes that some U.S. \ncitizens may wish for a private attorney, interpreter and/or other \nthird party of their choice to physically accompany them to the \nappointment. Particularly when an individual is seeking to document \ntheir citizenship and/or request other services offered by the American \nCitizens Services Unit at a U.S. embassy or consulate, the Department's \ngoal is to facilitate as much as possible a U.S. citizen's choice of \nwhom, if anyone, they wish to accompany them. This discretion to choose \nmay be critical for persons of limited resources who may not be able to \nafford an attorney, and/or for the most vulnerable, including the \nelderly or disabled. Additionally, time and resource constraints as \nwell as logistical difficulties in establishing a set of required \nqualifications to apply equally in all cases, which would require post \nand/or headquarters to verify information to ensure compliance, would \nunnecessarily complicate and limit the applicant/requester's ability to \nidentify someone who may be eligible to accompany them. The Department \nwill confirm that the applicant/requester has asked the third party to \nbe present and will verify that the third party is cleared by \nDiplomatic Security using the applicable security procedures. The \nDepartment will include appropriate language on its public-facing \nwebsite about the policy that will also inform the public that: (1) the \nDepartment does not require anyone to have an attorney or other third \nparty to obtain and/or attend an appointment for a covered service; (2) \nthe Department neither requires a third party to have, nor does the \nDepartment check to ensure that a third party has, any specific \nqualifications (beyond meeting security requirements); and, (3) that \npermitting a third party to attend an appointment in no way constitutes \nan endorsement of the third party and/or a representation that the \nthird party has certain, or any, qualifications and/or ability to \nprovide any assistance to the applicant/requester.\n\nTopic 2: Scope of Covered Appointments\n\n    One comment urged the Department to consider expanding the proposed \nrule to allow attorneys to accompany their clients to immigrant visa \nand nonimmigrant visa interviews at U.S. embassies and consulates \nabroad. For decades the Department has deferred to consular sections in \ndeciding whether attorneys or other third parties may be present at a \nvisa interview; applying a uniform approach surrounding visa \nappointments does not account for the differing capacity, logistical, \nand security constraints, among other considerations that only the \nconsular section can best assess. There are also different legal \nrequirements and considerations pertaining to visa interviews that must \nbe examined. For these reasons, we continue to defer to consular \nsections in deciding whether attorneys or other third parties may be \npresent at a visa interview.\n\nTopic 3: Proposed Amendments to 22 CFR 50.40(f)\n\n    One commenter requested that the Department ``more clearly reflect \nand clarify'' the view that an applicant's/requester's attorney may be \npresent throughout all stages of the process to request a Certificate \nof Loss of Nationality of the United States (CLN), up to and including \nthe administration of the oath of renunciation, as articulated by \nEdward A. Betancourt in his 2008 letter to the commenter (attached to \nthe comment).\n    The Department recognizes the importance of consistent application \nacross all posts of a rule permitting an attorney, interpreter, and/or \nother third party to attend interviews related to a request for a CLN \nand to be present (at the request of the U.S. citizen) when a U.S. \ndiplomatic or consular officer administers an oath of renunciation to \nthe U.S. citizen under Immigration and Nationality Act section \n349(a)(5) (8 U.S.C. 1481). The Department intends to take all \nappropriate steps to ensure compliance with the terms of this rule, and \nwill update guidance to its employees in its Foreign Affairs Manual \n(FAM). To the extent that the commenter may be requesting a change to \nthe proposed text of the rule to ``more clearly reflect and clarify'' \nthe views articulated by Edward A. Betancourt in 2008, the Department \nbelieves that the text of 22 CFR 50.40(f) is clear and consistent with \nsuch views and declines to further amend the text.\n    Specifically, 22 CFR 50.40(f) provides that individuals may, at \ntheir own expense, have a private attorney, interpreter, and/or other \nthird party of their own choice physically present during any in-person \nappointment, including interview appointments, at a U.S. embassy or \nconsulate abroad related to a request for a Certificate of Loss of \nNationality (CLN) [emphasis added]. The words ``any in-person \nappointment'' clearly encompass any in-person appointment, including \none at which the oath of renunciation is administered.\n    Secondly, even though the text will generally permit an attorney's \nphysical presence at any in-person appointment, consistent with the \nviews expressed by Edward A. Betancourt in his 2008 letter, the text in \n22 CFR 50.40(f)(4) clearly provides for diplomatic or consular officer \ndiscretion by stating the diplomatic or consular officer conducting the \ninterview shall have the discretion to interview the individual alone, \nwithout an attorney and/or other third party present, when necessary to \nevaluate whether the individual has performed a potentially \nexpatriating act independently, free from duress or coercion, and with \nintent to relinquish U.S. nationality.\n    While this text is somewhat broader than that which Edward A. \nBetancourt used in his 2008 letter (i.e., Mr. Betancourt stated that \nthe U.S. diplomatic or consular officer may exercise discretion in \ndetermining whether to permit an attorney to attend the oath of \nrenunciation, whereas this rule covers any stage of the process as \nwarranted by the circumstances), diplomatic or consular officer \ndiscretion supports the consular officer's responsibility to evaluate \nvoluntariness and intent and helps ensure the integrity of the process \nat all stages, including at an initial interview.\n    Finally, although the text of 22 CFR 50.40(f) specifies that the \nrequester must personally respond to the diplomatic or consular \nofficer's questions, it does not preclude an attorney from addressing \nthe consular officer should a legal question arise during the \ninterview.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n    The Department published this rulemaking as a proposed rule and \nprovided 60 days for public comment. The effective date of this final \nrule will be 30 days from date of publication.\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n    The Department of State, in accordance with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and, by \napproving it, certifies that this rulemaking will not have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \nOnly individuals, and no small entities, apply for passports or CRBAs \nor other services offered by the American Citizens Services (ACS) units \nat U.S. embassies and consulates overseas.\n\n[[Page 41310]]\n\nCongressional Review Act\n    This rule has not been designated as ``major'' within the meaning \nof the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.\nUnfunded Mandates Act of 1995\n    This final rule does not result in the expenditure by state, local, \nand tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of \n$100 million or more in any year and it will not significantly or \nuniquely affect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed \nnecessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n1995.\nExecutive Orders 12866, 14094, and 13563\n    The Department has reviewed this final rule to ensure its \nconsistency with the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in \nExecutive Order 12866. Applicants appearing for passport and/or CRBA \nappointments, or seeking certain other services from an ACS unit \noverseas, occasionally request that a private attorney, interpreter, or \nother third party physically accompany them to the appointment; \nhowever, there is nothing in the Department's regulations that \ncurrently addresses this. The Department finds that the cost of this \nrulemaking to the public is expected to be minimal and provides a \npotential benefit to individuals who wish an attorney, interpreter, or \nother third party to accompany them to a passport, CRBA, or other \nappointment at an ACS unit overseas. At the same time, those who wish \nto appear without being accompanied by such individuals may do so; this \nrulemaking does not mandate any change in the public's behavior. \nAdditionally, the Department does not anticipate that demand for \npassport, CRBA, or other services at ACS units overseas will change as \na result of this rulemaking. In summary, the Department anticipates no \nsubstantive impact on the public from this final rule. The Department \nof State has considered this final rule in light of Executive Order \n13563, dated January 18, 2011, and affirms that this regulation is \nconsistent with the guidance therein.\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132--Federalism\n    This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, \non the relationship between the National Government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government. Therefore, in accordance with section 6 of \nExecutive Order 13132, it is determined that this rulemaking does not \nhave sufficient federalism implications to require consultations or \nwarrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact statement. The \nregulations implementing E.O. 12372 regarding intergovernmental \nconsultation on Federal programs and activities do not apply to this \nregulation.\nExecutive Order 13175--Consultation With Tribal Governments\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking does not have \ntribal implications, does not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and does not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of E.O. 13175 do not apply to this rule.\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n    This rulemaking does not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35.\n\nList of Subjects\n\n22 CFR Part 50\n\n    Citizenship and Naturalization.\n\n22 CFR Part 51\n\n    Passports.\n\n22 CFR Part 71\n\n    Protection of U.S. citizens abroad.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, 22 CFR \nparts 50, 51, and 71 are amended as follows:\n\nPART 50--NATIONALITY PROCEDURES\n\n0\n1. The authority for part 50 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  22 U.S.C. 2651a; 8 U.S.C. 1104 and 1401 through \n1504.\n\n\n0\n2.

All persons entering a U.S. embassy or \nconsulate shall comply with all policies, security directives, \nguidelines, and protocols including but not limited to those regarding \nsecurity, identification, screening, electronic devices, recording, \nhealth, and conduct.

    "supplementary_information": "The 2023 Interim Final Rule, effective April \n27, 2023 (88 FR 18249), allows sponsors to sign Forms DS-2019 using \ndigital signatures and to transmit Forms DS-2019 electronically to a \nspecified list of recipients. In this final rule, the Department of \nState addresses the comments that parties submitted in response to the \n2023 Interim Final Rule and makes minor revisions to the regulatory \nlanguage. Most of the 64 commenting parties addressed two topics: \nsponsor preference for electronic signatures rather than digital \nsignatures, and the need for sponsors to electronically transmit Forms \nDS-2019 directly to third parties acting on their behalf. After \nconsideration, the Department of State has retained the requirement for \ndigital signatures for signing Forms DS-2019, and it makes no changes \nto the list of entities to which sponsors may transmit Forms DS-2019 \nelectronically. However, this rule will modify the regulations at 22 \nCFR 62.12(c)(3) to allow third parties to retrieve Forms DS-2019 \ndirectly from sponsors' password-protected computer network systems \nand/or databases. This modification allows third parties to retrieve \ncopies of digital Forms DS-2019 directly from sponsors that wish to \ngive them such access.\n    The Department of State also continues to permit sponsors to wet \nsign and physically mail Forms DS-2019 to exchange visitors and/or \nthird parties. Sponsors that find the functionality of digital \nsignatures too burdensome or costly or wish to continue to send Forms \nDS-2019 in bulk to third parties are not required to adopt the new \nprocedures.\n    In addition to commenting on the proposed regulations, many parties \nsubmitted questions and/or requests for clarification. To the extent \nsuch inquiries relate to this rulemaking, the Department of State will \naddress them herein. Otherwise, the Department of State recommends that \ninterested parties refer to <a href=\"http://J1visa.state.gov\">J1visa.state.gov</a> for more detailed guidance \nand/or direct specific queries to the <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"6309061b000b020d0406102310170217064d040c15\">[email&#160;protected]</a> or to one of \nthe category-specific email accounts.\n\nDigital Versus Electronic Signatures\n\n22 CFR 62.12(b)(2)(iii)\n\n    Seventeen of the parties submitting comments on the 2023 Interim \nFinal Rule addressed the Department of State's decision to allow \nResponsible Officers and Alternate Responsible Officers (collectively, \nOfficers) to sign Forms DS-2019 with ``digital'' signature software as \nopposed to the broader category of ``electronic'' signature software, \nof which digital is a subset. These parties offered the following \nreasons in support of their requests that the Department of State allow \nelectronic signatures: (1) the definition of ``digital software'' in \nthe 2023 Interim Final Rule is too vague for sponsors to know whether \ntheir software selections meet regulatory requirements; (2) the \ncryptographical requirements of digital software increase costs and \nburdens; (3) the vetting of Officers and their limited access to the \nStudent and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) already provide \na high level of security; (4) wet-signed, printed, scanned, and \nconverted-to-portable document format (pdf) Forms DS-2019 are no more \nor less secure than those signed with electronic signature software and \nelectronically transmitted; (5) it is cumbersome and costly for \nsponsors with J and F programs to have two operating procedures; (6) \nthe Department of State already accepts electronic signatures on the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Forms I-20 (Certificate \nof Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status); and (7) the variety of \nprinted Forms DS-2019 (given different signature, printing, and paper \noptions) may confuse U.S. Government authorities who grant J visas, \ndetermine admissibility and entry into the United States, or otherwise \nreview Forms DS-2019. The Department of State considered many of these \nfactors when it originally decided to require the higher level of \nsecurity that digital signatures offer, and it continues to believe \nthat the benefits of such security overcome the concerns of commenting \nparties. It addresses each issue individually as follows:\n    Definition of digital signature. Seven commenting parties expressed \nconfusion over the Department of State's definition of ``digital \nsignature.'' Sponsors can utilize any digital signature software that \nis an application of technology for cryptographically derived \nsignatures that is supported by a process such as a public key \ninfrastructure and that ensures meaningful authentication of the \nidentity of the signer and integrity of the document. Two examples are \nDocuSign[supreg] and Adobe Acrobat[supreg] Sign, and there are numerous \nother examples of digital signature technologies with which the public \nmay be familiar. In response to questions from commenting parties, the \nDepartment of State identifies some examples of signatures that are not \nconsidered digital for purposes of regulatory compliance: copied and \npasted signatures, signatures drawn via computer mouse, and typed \nsignatures. The Department of State continues to believe that sponsors \nmay consult either internal or external information technology experts \nwho can\n\n[[Page 30269]]\n\nreadily confirm whether a particular software package offers the degree \nof security necessary to differentiate digital signatures from other \ntypes of electronic signatures, thereby meeting the new regulatory \nrequirements.\n    Increased costs and burdens. Nine commenting parties opined that \nthe implementation of digital signature software would be costly and \nburdensome. The cost and complexity of implementing digital signature \ncapability varies within the sponsor community, based on many factors. \nSome sponsors may find that it is not cost effective to implement \ndigital signature capability, and they may opt instead to continue with \nbusiness as usual (using wet signatures). Other sponsors may have \nalready implemented such capacity, allowing them to benefit from \nreduced costs and burdens. By retaining the current methodologies while \nintroducing new options, the Department of State allows those sponsors \nthat do not wish to incur different costs or new burdens to maintain \ntheir current operating procedures.\n    SEVIS access vetting provides sufficient security. One commenting \nparty stated that digital signatures were unnecessary since sufficient \nsecurity was provided by vetting Officers and requiring passwords to \naccess SEVIS. However, the process of signing and transmitting Forms \nDS-2019 occurs outside of SEVIS, making credentialed access to SEVIS an \ninsufficient protection for these two functions.\n    Comparability of Electronic Signatures and Wet-Signed and Scanned \nSignatures. Four commenting parties opined that wet-signed, printed, \nscanned, and converted-to-pdf Forms DS-2019 offer similar security as \nelectronically signed and transmitted Forms DS-2019s. The Department of \nState respectfully disagrees. If a fraud investigation involved a Form \nDS-2019, the form would likely be returned to the sponsor to determine \nwhether a signature was legitimate. At the very least, wet-signed \ndocuments--whether transmitted electronically or via mail--bear \nsignatures that are exclusive to a limited group of authorized and \nvetted signatories. Although wet-signed signatures may be copied, \nOfficers can attest to the authenticity of their signatures and/or \nwhether they recall processing and signing forms that others may \nsuspect are fraudulent.\n    Visual review of forms signed with most electronic software, \nhowever, would not offer any clues as to their legitimacy since most \nelectronic signatures lack both the personalization of wet signatures \nand the encrypted traceability of digital signatures. For example, \nelectronic signatures may be typed names, typed names in italics, or a \nsignature made with a computer mouse, representations that are \ndifficult to verify as to their source. Further, the volume of forms \nsome Officers process would reduce the likelihood that they could \nrecognize a form as one that they, a coworker, or former employee \nsigned electronically.\n    Different treatment of Forms DS-2019 and Forms I-20 increases \nburden and cost. Nine commenting parties expressed concern that having \nto process Forms DS-2019 differently than Forms I-20 would increase \ntheir burden and cost. Sponsors that processed both Forms DS-2019 and \nForms I-20 prior to publication of the 2023 Interim Final Rule already \nfollowed two separate processes. Since sponsors may continue to print \nand wet-sign Forms DS-2019, implementation of digital signature \nsoftware does not disrupt the status quo. That is, sponsors can \ncontinue to conduct two processes, and they are not required to adopt a \npotentially more costly alternative. Moreover, those sponsors that wish \nto continue wet-signing Forms DS-2019 may now avail themselves of the \ncost- and time-saving electronic transmission of such forms.\n    Department of State already accepts electronically signed Forms I-\n20. Eight commenting parties stated that there was no reason for the \nDepartment of State to use a different signing process than DHS \nrequires for Forms I-20. The Department of State and DHS have always \nindependently assessed the risks associated with their respective \ninternational exchange programs, and whether electronic signatures \noffer sufficient security for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program \n(SEVP) has no bearing on the security requirements for Forms DS-2019. \nThe Department of State has promulgated specific regulations for the \nExchange Visitor Program based on its assessment of the risks \nassociated with the Program that may not apply to all SEVP activities.\n    In their comments, many sponsors sought the capability to transmit \nForms DS-2019 electronically to third parties acting on their behalf, \nciting the important role third parties play in their exchange \nprograms. Although the Department of State continues to prohibit this \nactivity, it has modified the regulations at 22 CFR 62.12(c)(3) to \nallow sponsors to permit third parties to retrieve copies of digital \nForms DS-2019 directly from sponsors' password-protected computer \nnetworks and databases, at the sponsors' discretion. It is the \nDepartment of State's understanding that the SEVP model does not \nsimilarly engage foreign third parties, thereby significantly reducing \nthe need to ensure protection and authenticity of their forms.\n    Another difference between SEVP activities (for F or M visa \nclassifications) and the Exchange Visitor Program involves the \nlocations at which students and exchange visitors are placed. For \nexample, except for F-1 students placed off-campus, e.g., to obtain \npractical work experience, participants entering the United States on \nF-visas are placed exclusively at SEVP-certified academic institutions. \nHowever, sponsors in the Private Sector categories of the Exchange \nVisitor Program (with approximately 200,000 exchange visitors starting \nnew programs each year) for the most part do not similarly place their \nexchange visitors at their own locations. Non-academic sponsors place \nexchange visitors at tens of thousands of different private businesses \nor other organizations that the Department of State does not vet. The \nsheer number, variety, and location of such placements present greater \nopportunities for fraud than do placements at a finite number of \ncertified academic institutions. These different levels of risk justify \ndifferent levels of security.\n    Different signatures and looks of Forms DS-2019 may confuse \nauthorities. Four commenting parties expressed concern that the variety \nof physical forms and signature types could confuse U.S. Customs and \nBorder agents, Social Security Administration officials, or even \nconsular officers at U.S. embassies or consulates. Prior to publishing \nthe 2023 Interim Final Rule, the Department of State alerted those \nentities that routinely process or review Forms DS-2019 of the upcoming \nregulatory changes. Moreover, in recent consultation with the \nDepartment of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs, the Office of Private \nSector Exchange confirmed that confusion has been minimal. Going \nforward, the Department of State is prepared to address any instances \nof confusion (e.g., turnarounds at ports of entry) should they \nmaterialize.\n    The Department of State has promulgated specific regulations for \nthe Exchange Visitor Program based on its assessment of the risks \nassociated with the Program that may not apply to SEVP activities. For \nexample, after the implementation of SEVIS in 2002, the Department of \nState required Officers to wet-sign Forms DS-2019 in blue ink to \ndifferentiate original documents from forgers. The Department of State, \ntherefore, confirms its decision to permit the more secure digital \nsoftware,\n\n[[Page 30270]]\n\nbut not generic electronic signature software.\n\nTransmission of Forms DS-2019\n\n    The second most frequently raised concern with the 2023 Interim \nFinal Rule is the limitation on the third parties to which sponsors may \nelectronically transmit Forms DS-2019. Ten parties objected to the \nexclusion of third parties (as defined in 22 CFR 62.2) of sponsors from \nthe enumerated list of authorized recipients of electronically \ntransmitted forms. Parties generally indicated that the visa interview \nprocess is facilitated by providing Forms DS-2019 directly to foreign \nthird parties who perform the critical functions of checking forms for \naccuracy, helping schedule group interviews, and forwarding batches of \nForms DS-2019 to consular sections at posts.\n    First, the Department of State clarifies that only individuals who \nare employees of a sponsor are considered ``staff'' for purposes of 22 \nCFR 62.12(c)(1). Staff at institutions that are designated sponsors are \nnot third parties, and third parties are not considered sponsor staff. \nTwo parties also questioned whether they could copy third parties when \nthey transmit Forms DS-2019 electronically to members of the Department \nof State's list of acceptable recipients. Since parties receive \nelectronic transmissions regardless of whether they are listed in the \n``to'' line or the ``cc'' line of an email message, sponsors may not \ncopy any entities that are not enumerated in 22 CFR 62.12(c)(1).\n    Five commenting parties asked whether sponsors could provide third \nparties with password-protected access to their computer network \nsystems and/or databases to allow them to log on to access electronic \nForms DS-2019. The Department of State believes that such credentialed \naccess provides a degree of security not available through emailing \nelectronic Forms DS-2019. There are millions of email accounts world-\nwide as opposed to the small number of third parties to which sponsors \nwould opt to grant network access. The risk of someone gaining \ninappropriate access to Forms DS-2019 is significantly minimized by \nrestricting access in this way. Accordingly, the Department of State \nhas modified the regulations at 22 CFR 62.12(c)(3) to permit this \nfunctionality. As a point of clarification, it notes that for purposes \nof these regulations, electronic transmission is limited to sponsor-\ninitiated sending of files to individuals or entities, including \nexchange visitors. Prior to making Forms DS-2019 available for third \nparties to retrieve, sponsors must either wet sign and convert forms to \nelectronic files or sign the forms with digital signatures since 22 CFR \n62.12(b)(2)(i) continues to allow only Officers present in the United \nStates or a U.S. territory to sign Forms DS-2019. The Department of \nState further reminds sponsors that even in a digital environment, \nthere is only one ``original'' Form DS-2019. If sponsors allow third \nparties to retrieve Forms DS-2019 from sponsor network systems and/or \ndatabases, they must not also mail or electronically transmit the same \nforms to individuals or entities listed in Sec.  62.12(c)(1). The \nDepartment of State has added regulatory language at 22 CFR 62.12(c)(4) \nto prohibit sponsors from issuing multiple copies of original Forms DS-\n2019.\n    For those sponsors that lack the capacity to give third parties \npassword-protected access to their computer network systems and/or \ndatabases or do not wish to provide such access, the Department of \nState reminds them that they may continue to wet-sign Forms DS-2019 and \nsend paper forms to third parties pursuant to 22 CFR 62.12(c)(2).\n    Other parties expressed concern that Exchange Visitor Program \napplicants may not have access to email and/or printing facilities. For \napplicants without email access, sponsors may continue to mail paper \nforms to applicants and/or to third parties. For applicants without \nprinters at home, the Department of State notes that schools, \nlibraries, and businesses often have printing capabilities that third \nparties may access for a minimal fee. Nothing in the regulations \nprohibits exchange visitors from, e.g., emailing Forms DS-2019 to other \nplaces, such as offices or friends' homes, for printing. The Department \nof State believes that these alternatives are sufficient so as not to \ndisrupt the role that third parties play in assisting sponsors and \nexchange visitors with the visa interview process.\n\nMiscellaneous Comments\n\n    Five parties asked for clarification on how the 2023 Interim Final \nRule changes the process of providing travel signatures on Forms DS-\n2019. The new regulations provide flexibility for signing and \ntransmitting Forms DS-2019 to approve travel. First, sponsors may \neither reprint Forms DS-2019, sign the travel signature space with any \ncolor of ink, and send them to exchange visitors using a delivery \nservice; or convert Forms DS-2019 to electronic files and transmit them \nelectronically. Alternatively, Officers may sign the travel signature \nspace of Forms DS-2019 using a digital signature and either transmit \nthem electronically or print them and send them via delivery service. \nSponsors that approve travel should advise exchange visitors to carry \nboth Forms DS-2019 when they leave the United States, i.e., the \noriginal paper forms and the subsequently issued forms with the travel \nauthorization signature. Parties also questioned whether they should \nsign reprinted Forms DS-2019 or have exchange visitors send their \noriginal Forms DS-2019 or electronic versions of the forms back to \ntheir sponsors for processing. The Department of State clarifies that \nall these options are available to sponsors.\n    Several parties asked how the new regulations impact use of the \n``reprint'' function in SEVIS, noting that sponsors cannot prohibit \nexchange visitors from reprinting the Forms DS-2019 their sponsors \nprovide. Although the Department of State agrees that sponsors cannot \neffectively monitor whether exchange visitors reprint or copy Forms DS-\n2019, the Department of State urges sponsors to advise exchange \nvisitors whose Forms DS-2019 are lost, stolen, or damaged to contact \ntheir sponsors and ask for new forms. Sponsors must not electronically \ntransmit or print previously issued Forms DS-2019, but rather, they \nmust use the reprint function in SEVIS and send the new forms \n(electronically or via mail) to the exchange visitor and/or their \naccompanying spouse or dependents, if any. On a related matter, two \nsponsors sought clarification on what sponsors should do if former \nexchange visitors request copies of their Forms DS-2019 after their \nprograms are over. Since the reprint function is available only for \nSEVIS records in ``initial'' and ``active'' status, sponsors should \ninform current exchange visitors of this limitation and encourage them \nto safeguard their original paperwork.\n    In the supplemental section of the 2023 Interim Final Rule, the \nDepartment of State indicated that it would eliminate the phrase ``or a \nchange in actual and current U.S. address'' from 22 CFR \n62.12(a)(3)(vii) because this example was not a valid reason to issue \nForms DS-2019. In response to one party's comment that the Department \nof State did not make this change in the regulatory text, the \nDepartment of State now corrects this oversight by deleting the phrase \nin this final rule.\n    The 2023 Interim Final Rule eliminated the requirement that \nOfficers who wish to continue to wet-sign paper Forms DS-2019 use only \nblue ink. In response to one commenting party's request for \nclarification, the Department of State confirms that it has eliminated \nthe requirement that Officers sign Forms DS-2019 in any specific color \nof ink.\n\n[[Page 30271]]\n\n    The introduction of electronic Forms DS-2019 and the potential for \nthe varying physical appearance of printed forms raised questions about \nexchange visitor signature requirements and signature requirements on \nother official Department of State forms. Four parties questioned \nwhether the 2023 Interim Final Rule had any impact on signature \nrequirements for, e.g., Forms DS-7002 (Training/Internship Placement \nPlan). The Department of State clarifies that the Exchange Visitor \nProgram regulations have never required other forms to be signed in a \nparticular color of ink and then distributed via mail delivery service. \nThe requirements set forth in the final rule apply only to Forms DS-\n2019. One commenting party asked whether exchange visitors were \nrequired to sign Forms DS-2019 in ink and another noted that the \nregulations were silent on whether exchange visitors could transmit \nForms DS-2019 electronically. The Department of State notes that this \nfinal rule regulates actions of designated sponsors, not exchange \nvisitors.\n    The addition of electronic Forms DS-2019 has raised other similar \nissues. Four parties sought clarification with respect to whether the \nrequirement at 22 CFR 62.10(g) that sponsors retain copies of records \nrelated to their exchange visitor programs for three years referred to \npaper or electronic files. Regulations governing the retention of \nrecords do not specify the format in which sponsors are required to \nretain records, leaving it up to sponsors to determine whether they \nwish to retain paper, electronic, or both paper and electronic records. \nElectronic records should reflect any changes during the program and be \nconsistent with the information in SEVIS, e.g., exchange visitors' \nprogram dates or visa status.\n\nRegulatory Analysis and Notices\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n    This final rule responds to public comments received on the 2023 \nInterim Final Rule and makes minor revisions to the provisions on the \ncontrol of DS-2019 forms in 22 CFR 62.12. For the reasons set forth in \nthe 2023 Interim Final Rule, the Department of State does not believe 5 \nU.S.C. 553(b) or (c) apply to this rulemaking.\nCongressional Review Act\n    This regulation is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804. \nThis rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant \nadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, \ninnovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based companies to compete with \nU.S.-based companies in domestic and export markets.\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n    This regulation will not result in the expenditure by State, local \nor Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of \n$100 million in any year, and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 \nU.S.C. 1501 et seq.).\nExecutive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n    The Department of State has determined that this regulation will \nnot have Tribal implications; will not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian Tribal governments; and will not preempt \nTribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\nRegulatory Flexibility Act: Small Business Impacts\n    Since this rule is exempt from section 553 (Rulemaking) and section \n554 (Adjudications) of the Administrative Procedure Act, this rule is \nnot subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. \n(1980)).\nExecutive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094\n    The Department of State has reviewed this rule to ensure its \nconsistency with the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in \nExecutive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Order 14094, and \nExecutive Order 13563, and affirms that this regulation is consistent \nwith the guidance therein. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \nhas designated this rule as not significant under E.O. 12866.\nExecutive Order 12988\n    The Department of State has reviewed this rulemaking considering \nsections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate \nambiguity, minimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and \nreduce burdens.\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132--Federalism\n    The Department of State finds that this regulation does not have \nsufficient federalism implications to require consultations or warrant \nthe preparation of a federalism summary impact statement.\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n    This rulemaking relates to OMB Control No. 1405-0119, Certificate \nof Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status (J-Nonimmigrant). The \nDepartment of State does not anticipate a reportable change in burden \nfor this information collection as a result of this rulemaking.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 62\n\n    Cultural exchange programs, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department of State \namends 22 CFR part 62 as follows:\n\nPART 62--EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAM\n\n0\n1. The authority citation to part 62 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J), 1182, 1184, 1258; 22 U.S.C. \n1431 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 2651a; 22 U.S.C. \n6531-6553; Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977, 42 FR 62461, 3 CFR \n1977 Comp. p. 200; E.O. 12048, 43 FR 13361, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. \n168; 8 U.S.C. 1372; section 416 of Pub.

    "abstract": "The Department of State (\"Department\") is amending its regulation governing immigrant visas by removing the section which allows a consular officer to conduct an informal evaluation of the family members of an immigrant visa applicant to identify potential grounds of ineligibility. The existing regulation was promulgated in 1952, at a time when a consular officer could more readily assess a family member's potential qualification for a visa without a formal visa application. Assessing eligibility for an immigrant visa is now a more complex task and not one which can be accomplished accurately with an informal evaluation.",

    "supplementary_information": "The Department published a notice of \nproposed rulemaking, Public Notice 11604 at 88 FR 16384 (Mar. 17, 2023) \n(hereafter ``proposed rule''), with a request for comments, proposing \nto amend Part 42 of Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The \nrule will eliminate 22 CFR 42.68 in its entirety. The regulatory \namendment was discussed in detail in the proposed rule, and that \ndiscussion is adopted by reference in this final rule. The Department \nreceived two responsive comments, both in support of eliminating 22 CFR \n42.68. The Department is now promulgating a final rule with no changes \nfrom the proposed rule. This rule results in no change for applicants, \nas the authority granted by 22 CFR 42.68 was no longer used by consular \nofficers.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See the proposed rule for further discussion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnalysis of Comments\n\n    The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on March \n17, 2023. The comment period closed May 16, 2023. The Department \nreceived two responsive comments, both in favor of the proposed \nelimination of 22 CFR 42.68, and one non-responsive comment.\n    One of the two responsive comments advocated for replacing 22 CFR \n42.68 with ``supportive and accessible eligibility screenings for \nnoncitizens seeking visas,'' while the other comment only expressed its \nsupport for the proposed elimination. The Department has considered \nthese comments. Considering the complexity required to evaluate a \nnoncitizen's eligibility for a visa, and limited resources to reliably \nassess eligibility absent a visa application, the Department is unable \nto offer any eligibility screenings. Noncitizens who wish to receive a \nnonimmigrant or immigrant visa must formally apply for a visa to allow \na consular officer to assess their eligibility for the visa.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nA. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    As this rule involves amending visa policy, which is a foreign \naffairs function of the United States, it is exempt from both the \ndelayed effective date and notice and comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. \n553 per subsection (a)(1). Notwithstanding the applicability of the \nforeign affairs exception to this rule, the Department, for its own \nbenefit, sought public comment on the proposed elimination of 22 CFR \n42.68. See, e.g., Hoctor v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 82 F.3d 165, 171-72 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (observing that there is nothing in the APA that \nforbids an agency's use of notice-and-comment procedures even if not \nrequired under the APA, and that courts should attach no weight to an \nagency's varied approaches involving similar rules). Though this rule \nis not subject to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the Department is also choosing to \ndelay the effective date of this rule for 30 days.\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    As this rulemaking is not required to be published for notice and \ncomment under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the regulatory \nflexibility analysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory\n\n[[Page 85110]]\n\nFlexibility Act. Nonetheless, as this rule eliminates a currently \nunused authority, the Department certifies that this rule will not have \na significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \nentities.\n\nC. Congressional Review Act\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined by the Congressional \nReview Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.). This rule will not result in an \nannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase \nin costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, \nemployment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of \nUnited States-based companies to compete with foreign-based companies \nin domestic and import markets.\n\nD. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094\n\n    Notwithstanding that the policies of the Secretary of State in \nexercising their authority to conduct international affairs through the \ngranting or refusal of visas to foreign nationals is a foreign affairs \nfunction, the Department has submitted this rule to OIRA for review and \nOIRA has deemed this rule to be not significant. The Department has \nalso considered this final rule in light of E.O. 13563 and E.O. 14094 \nand affirms that this rule is consistent with the guidance therein.\n    As noted in the NPRM, the Visa Office consulted with management in \nthe immigrant visa units of five of the largest-volume immigrant visa \nprocessing posts: Ciudad Juarez, Manila, Santo Domingo, Mumbai, and \nDhaka. Each of the five posts reported they do not provide this \nservice. Given that these five posts process 32 percent of the \nimmigrant visas worldwide, and they have no information regarding the \nprovision of this service, we are confident that eliminating this \nregulation will not result in significant impacts.\n\nE. Executive Order 13175\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to \nthis rulemaking.\n\nF. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35.\n\nG. Other\n\n    The Department has also considered this rule under the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995 and Executive Orders 12372, 13132, and \n13272 and affirms this rule is consistent with the applicable mandates \nor guidance therein.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Immigration, Passports, Visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, 22 CFR 42 \nis amended as follows:\n\nPART 42--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION \nAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.

    "supplementary_information": "On April 16, 2013, the Department published \na final rule revising Category VIII of the USML (78 FR 22740). That \nfinal rule added USML Category VIII(h)(1) to describe parts, \ncomponents, accessories, attachments, and equipment specially designed \nfor certain advanced U.S.-origin aircraft. Paragraph (h)(1) was the\n\n[[Page 84073]]\n\nexception to the revised Category VIII's positive list of specific \ntypes of parts, components, accessories, and attachments that continue \nto warrant control on the USML. Other parts, components, accessories, \nand attachments specially designed for a military aircraft and related \narticles became subject to the new ``600 series'' controls in Category \n9 of the Commerce Control List (CCL).\n    On October 3, 2013, the Department published a rule (78 FR 61750) \nthat added a Note to USML Category VIII(h)(1) to clarify that parts, \ncomponents, accessories, and attachments that are common to aircraft \nenumerated in paragraph (a) but not identified in paragraph (h)(1), and \nthose identified in paragraph (h)(1), are not specially designed.\n    On November 21, 2016, the Department published another final rule \nrevising Category VIII (81 FR 83126), which updated the list of \naircraft in paragraph (h)(1) and revised the Note to paragraph (h)(1) \nto incorporate technical corrections and enhance its clarity. The rule \nalso removed equipment from paragraph (h)(1) and created paragraph \n(h)(29) to describe certain equipment specially designed for articles \ndescribed in paragraph (h)(1). Paragraph (h)(1) currently describes \nparts, components, accessories, and attachments specially designed for \nthe following U.S.-origin aircraft: B-1B, B-2, B-21, F-15SE, F/A-18 E/\nF, EA-18G, F-22, F-35, and future variants thereof; or the F-117 or \nU.S. Government technology demonstrators. Paragraph (h)(1) further \nstates that parts, components, accessories, and attachments of the F-\n15SE and F/A-18 E/F that are common to earlier models of these \naircraft, unless listed elsewhere in paragraph (h) of Category VIII, \nare subject to the EAR.\n    The Note to paragraph (h)(1) states that paragraph (h)(1) does not \ncontrol parts, components, accessories, and attachments that are common \nto aircraft described in paragraph (a) of Category VIII but not \nidentified in paragraph (h)(1), and those identified in paragraph \n(h)(1). For example, when applying Sec.  120.41(b)(3), a part common to \nonly the F-16 and F-35 is not specially designed for purposes of \nparagraph (h)(1). A part common to only the F-22 and F-35--two aircraft \nmodels identified in paragraph (h)(1)--is specially designed for \npurposes of paragraph (h)(1), unless one of the other paragraphs under \nITAR Sec.  120.41(b) is applicable.\n    Section 126.2 of the ITAR provides that the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Defense Trade Controls may order the temporary suspension \nor modification of any or all provisions of the ITAR when in the \ninterest of the security and foreign policy of the United States. This \nauthority may also be exercised by the Assistant Secretary for \nPolitical-Military Affairs according to ITAR Sec.  120.1(b).\n    The Department assesses that it is in the security and foreign \npolicy interests of the United States to allow manufacturers to apply \nfor export authorizations to participate in development of the KF-21 \naircraft by reusing certain defense articles described in paragraph \n(h)(1) without removing those defense articles from the USML simply \nbecause they are re-used in the KF-21.\n    Accordingly, pursuant to ITAR Sec.  126.2, the Assistant Secretary \nof State for Political-Military Affairs hereby temporarily modifies the \nNote to paragraph (h)(1) of USML Category VIII such that parts, \ncomponents, accessories, and attachments specially designed for \naircraft identified in paragraph (h)(1) are not released from that \nparagraph due to their reuse in the KF-21 aircraft or variants thereof.\n    The Department assessed that this temporary modification does not \nchange the export jurisdiction or classification of any existing \ncommodities, as it only prevents the possibility of future release from \nparagraph (h)(1) due to use in the KF-21, which has not yet entered \ninto production. Therefore, when the KF-21 enters production, any \nparagraph (h)(1) commodities authorized for export for this purpose \nwill retain their current export classification described in paragraph \n(h)(1).\n    This temporary modification will be effective until December 1, \n2024, or when terminated by the Department, whichever occurs first.\n\nRegulatory Analysis and Notices\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rulemaking is exempt from section 553 of the Administrative \nProcedure Act (APA) pursuant to section 553(a)(1) as a military or \nforeign affairs function of the United States.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    Since this rule is exempt from the notice-and-comment rulemaking \nprovisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, it does not require analysis under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This rulemaking does not involve a mandate that will result in the \nexpenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, \nor by the private sector of $100 million or more in any year and it \nwill not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, \nno actions were deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    The Department assesses that this rule is not a major rule under \nthe criteria of 5 U.S.C. 804.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132\n\n    This rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to \nrequire consultations or warrant the preparation of a federalism \nsummary impact statement. The regulations implementing Executive Order \n12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and \nactivities do not apply to this rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 (as amended by Executive Order 14094) and \n13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available \nregulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select \nregulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential \neconomic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributed \nimpacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance \nof quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of \nharmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule has not been \ndeemed a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. \nAccordingly, the rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB).\n\nExecutive Order 12988\n\n    The Department of State has reviewed this rulemaking in light of \nsections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate \nambiguity, minimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and \nreduce burden.\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    The Department of State has determined that this rulemaking will \nnot have tribal implications, will not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian tribal governments, and will not preempt \ntribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rulemaking does not impose or revise any information \ncollections subject to 44 U.S.C.

The program develops young \nforeign ambassadors who return to their home countries more aware of \nAmerican values, culture, and leadership, and provides reciprocal \ncultural and educational benefits to the American families hosting the \nau pair visitor, especially the young children in the au pair's care.\n    The Department of State has carefully crafted a uniform system of \nregulations designed to protect au pairs and their host families while \nmaintaining an environment conducive to a comprehensive federal \neducational and cultural exchange program. It is the development of \nmutual understanding and shared cultures that benefits au pairs, their \nhost families and communities, and the foreign relations of the United \nStates. American host families compensate au pairs and subsidize the \nprogram's required educational and cultural component, while exposing \ntheir children to international and intercultural differences and \nsimilarities.\n    The Department of State's public diplomacy objectives are best \nrealized if all participants in the Exchange Visitor Program have \npositive cultural immersion experiences. The au pair program is only \none of two programs that place exchange visitors into private homes, a \nsituation that requires recognition of the sensitive relationships that \nmay develop in such a merged household, when participants may not \nalways have the same expectations. Decades of au pair placements have \nconfirmed that regulations governing this category must include \nenhanced monitoring requirements and protections for au pairs to \nsafeguard their health, safety, and welfare, as well as their positive \nexperiences as exchange visitors and to ensure that the interests of au \npairs are fully respected. Au pairs specifically participate in a \nunique program that requires living with a host family to foster direct \nparticipation in their home life while providing child care.\n    The Department of State acknowledges concerns by interested third \nparties that there is a significant geographic variation in the cost of \nliving across the United States and about whether the federal minimum \nwage rate in some states is sufficient to cover au pair expenses. There \nis also an increase in the number of states and localities where the \nminimum wage exceeds the federal minimum wage. The Department of State \nalso understands that collaboration with all stakeholders, including \norganizations that advocate on behalf of domestic workers, advances the \nobjective of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of au pairs. Au \npairs participating in a foreign policy program must be adequately \ncompensated and protected from abuse.\n    The Department of State underscores the cultural immersion purpose \nof the au pair program, which has always distinguished au pairs from \ndomestic childcare workers. At the same time, the Department of State \nwants to ensure au pairs have similar protections as those afforded to \ndomestic workers. To this end, the Department of State proposes \nredefining the structure of the au pair program options and their \nassociated hours and compensation calculations, including incorporating \ndifferences in federal, state, and local minimum wage rates so that the \nhighest applicable rate within each tier (or the highest applicable \nminimum wage rate, if higher) applies to all au pairs. At the same \ntime, the Department of State would preserve other fundamental elements \nof the Au pair category that underpin the success of this cultural \nexchange program as an immersion into American family life.\n\nProgram Structure\n\n    In accordance with its exclusive regulatory authority and to \nfurther the foreign policy and diplomacy goals of the Fulbright-Hays \nAct, the Department of State devised the Au pair category of the \nExchange Visitor Program to be distinct from domestic childcare \nworkers. While the au pair program provides many families with high-\nquality childcare, the program specializes in providing an enriching \ncultural experience for the children and for a young person from \nanother country. The Department of State (and formerly the U.S. \nInformation Agency) has implemented and overseen the Au pair category \nsince its inception as a federally regulated program that effectuates a \nvariety of foreign affairs objectives, including promoting cultural \nexchange and fostering mutual understanding. It serves as a unique \ndiplomatic tool that achieves the Fulbright-Hays Act goals by inviting \nyoung foreign persons to live and provide childcare with American \nfamilies, learn, and absorb our culture and language, pursue additional \neducational opportunities, and then return to their home countries.\n    To further enhance the au pair program, the Department of State is \nproposing to set certain baselines for this type of exchange program \nand limit the number of childcare hours per program as outlined in \nproposed Sec.  62.31(a). Au pairs and host families would choose either \na ``part-time'' program with childcare hours between 24-31 hours per \nweek, or a full-time program of child care hours between\n\n[[Page 74073]]\n\n32-40 hours per week. As further discussed below, the au pair's weekly \nchildcare compensation would be based on the maximum hours of the \nchosen option, even if the au pair worked fewer hours. Under this new \nstructure, au pairs would not work hours in excess of each option's \nmaximum limit, except under very limited exigent circumstances with \nnotification by the host family to the sponsor as described below. \nSponsors must have policies and contingency plans in place for host \nfamilies that need to report exigent circumstances and are responsible \nfor ensuring excess childcare hours are infrequent. When part-time au \npairs work more than 31 hours in a week but not more than 40 hours, \nthey would be compensated for those excess hours at the hourly rate of \nthe applicable tier identified in proposed paragraph (n)(4)(ii) of the \nregulations. When part-time or full-time au pairs work over 40 hours in \na week, they would be compensated for those excess hours at the hourly \nrate of the applicable tier identified in proposed paragraph (n)(4)(ii) \nof the regulations, and they must also be paid any overtime premium due \nunder applicable federal, state, or local law. In addition, under the \nproposal, au pairs must be paid any other overtime premiums due under \napplicable federal, state, or local law for other hours worked. For \nexample, California law currently calculates overtime pay due on a \ndaily basis. Proposed paragraph (j)(8) would require in the Host Family \nAgreement a provision that host families that have au pairs provide \nchildcare duties for more than the maximum number of hours permitted \nmust report this within five calendar days to the sponsor and explain \nthe exigent circumstance requiring the additional hours. The Department \nof State proposes in paragraph (m)(7) that frequent reports of the au \npair providing childcare in excess of the maximum number of hours \npermitted or a failure to report could lead to the host family's \ntermination from the au pair program.\n    The current EduCare option, under which au pairs are limited to 30 \nhours of weekly childcare to allow more time for study, is being \nreplaced by the ``part-time'' program, with a weekly childcare range of \n24 to 31 hours. The Department of State believes the name change will \nfacilitate distinguishing between the two program options, and that, as \ndiscussed further below, the modification to the hour limitations will \nensure a better understanding by host families of the need to ensure \nthat au pairs have sufficient time to pursue the educational and \ncultural exchange aspects of the program. The language under paragraph \n(b) has also been updated to mirror other recent category changes and \nremove the sentence, ``Such designation shall be for a period of two \nyears and may be revoked by the Department of State for good cause'' as \nthis subject is now covered in 22 CFR 62.6(b).\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Exchange Visitor Program--General Provisions, 79 FR 60307 \n(Oct. 6, 2014).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The proposed rule maintains many regulatory provisions that have \nbeen successful over the years. However, the Department of State \nrecognizes that there are many ways to modernize the au pair program, \nensuring it is consistent with the authorizing legislation's focus on \nthe foreign policy objective of advancing mutual understanding, while \nat the same time protecting the health, safety, and welfare of these \nexchange visitors. The proposed rule reflects this balance and \nmaintains the program as a world class U.S. public diplomacy initiative \nfocused on an educational and cultural mission. Major revisions \nproposed in this proposed rule include requiring sponsors to develop \nstandard operating procedures and internal controls; increased au pair \nand host family orientation requirements; a higher standard of vetting \nfor au pairs and host families; provisions governing sponsor \nrelationships with third parties acting on their behalf; increased \nprotections for au pairs; enhanced educational options (including \nvirtual classes and volunteerism); additional reporting requirements; \nand finally, the proposed formalization of and expansion of a Host \nFamily Agreement between au pairs and host families. None of the \nproposed requirements placed on sponsors in this proposed rule modify \nthe ``General obligations of sponsors,'' as enumerated upon in 22 CFR \n62.9. As 22 CFR 62.9(d)(5) states, with regard to both the au pair \nprogram and the other exchange visitor programs that the Department of \nState oversees, a sponsor must ``not represent that its exchange \nvisitor program is endorsed, sponsored or supported by the Department \nof State or the U.S. Government, except for U.S. Government sponsors or \nexchange visitor programs financed directly by the U.S. Government to \npromote international education exchanges.'' Thus, as 22 CFR 62.9(d)(5) \nmakes clear, the au pair program and its implementing regulations do \nnot create a relationship of agency, contract, or representation \nbetween the United States government and a program sponsor, and nothing \nin this rulemaking alters the status of that relationship.\n\nHost Family Agreement\n\n    The Department of State is aware that each sponsor implements a \nHost Family Agreement between the host family and the au pair. While \nthe Host Family Agreement is not a contract, it reflects the \nunderstanding between the host family and the au pair regarding the au \npair's terms of placement and expected day-to-day activities. In order \nto further reinforce program transparency, the Department of State \nproposes to require sponsors to outline placement-specific minimum \nrequirements and disclosures in each Host Family Agreement. The \nproposed provision at 22 CFR 62.31(j) requires Host Family Agreements \nto clearly describe all sponsor and third-party fees associated with \nthe exchange program, expected childcare duties, hours, compensation, \nroom and board and all other deductions from compensation, paid time \noff for vacation and sick leave, the educational allowance, and any \nrequired training. The Department of State wants to ensure that both au \npairs and host families establish realistic expectations of the au pair \nexperience. Operating from a common point of understanding is key to a \nsuccessful program.\n    First and foremost, the Department of State proposes that the Host \nFamily Agreement must specifically identify and list duties and tasks \nacceptable to the au pair and the host family, consistent with the \nregulation's guidance on tasks that are appropriate for an au pair. Au \npairs should not engage in, and the Host Family Agreement must not \ninclude, inappropriate duties as set out in proposed paragraph \n(j)(2)(ii). All expected and agreed upon duties must be identified \nprior to signing the agreement, though the agreement may be later \nupdated. Au pairs are not required to perform any tasks not listed in \nthe Host Family Agreement. Any tasks outside the Host Family Agreement \nperformed by the au pair must be voluntary and infrequent, but they may \nnot include activities under paragraph (j)(2)(ii). Au pairs may add \nclarifying language when signing the initial Host Family Agreement or \nthrough an amendment to the Host Family Agreement, to identify and add \nappropriate duties not listed in paragraph (j)(2)(i). Any changes to \nthe initial or modified Host Family Agreement must be agreed upon in \nwriting by the au pair and host family per proposed paragraph (j)(14).\n    The Department of State proposes to require that the Host Family \nAgreement\n\n[[Page 74074]]\n\ninclude a typical weekly schedule which the sponsor has reviewed to \nensure it complies with regulatory requirements (proposed paragraph \n(j)(3)). Although emergencies arise and there will be occasional \ndeviations from the schedule, the creation of a typical weekly schedule \nallows au pairs to better plan their off-duty time (e.g., pursue \ncultural activities or the educational component). As with the duty \nlists, host families or au pairs seeking to modify the weekly schedule \npermanently would be required to submit the proposed change to the \nsponsor for review and approval before seeking written approval from \nthe au pair or host family. The Host Family Agreement would also \nspecify that child care hours in excess of the maximum hours allowed \nunder the au pair's program (31 or 40 hours/week) are subject to a \nseparate reporting requirement for host families.\n    The Department of State proposes to require sponsors to establish \nstandard operating procedures covering amendment to or termination of \nHost Family Agreements and in the event an au pair or host family \nrequests a rematch (proposed Sec.  62.31(c)(1)(ii)). The Host Family \nAgreement does not prevent an au pair or host family from requesting a \nrematch or ending their participation in the au pair program.\n\nProgram Conditions\n\n    The Department of State also proposes to change the name of the \ncurrent Sec.  62.31(c) ``Program eligibility'' to ``Program \nconditions'' to better capture the functionality of the provisions in \nthis paragraph. Over the years, the term ``eligibility'' has become \nassociated with baseline qualifications that enable certain entities to \nassume distinct roles in the Exchange Visitor Program, (e.g., entities \nseeking to become sponsors, sponsors seeking to become redesignated, \nfamilies seeking to host exchange visitors, and foreign nationals \nseeking to become exchange visitors). Accordingly, the sponsor \nobligations that are not directly associated with the basic core \nprogrammatic functions (i.e., screening, selecting, placing, \nmonitoring, and promoting mutual understanding), are included under the \nheading ``Program conditions.''\n    The Department of State is proposing that a sponsor's local \ncoordinator must not have a family or work connection with any of the \nhost families in which they have monitoring responsibilities (proposed \nparagraph (c)(2)(ii)). The Department of State is also proposing that a \nlocal coordinator who is only working part-time (fewer than 32 hours \nper week) must be responsible for placement and monitoring of no more \nthan 15 au pairs (proposed paragraph (c)(2)(iii)). Local coordinators \nwho work full-time for an au pair sponsor may be responsible for no \nmore than 30 au pair placements (proposed paragraph (c)(2)(iv)). This \nwill allow the local coordinators to spend more quality time monitoring \nthe au pairs.\n    The Department of State continues to place a high priority on \nensuring the health, safety, and welfare of exchange visitors on \nexchange programs in the United States. Although nearly 40 years have \npassed since the inception of the Au pair category, certain situations \ncontinue to exist that require more focused regulatory attention. The \ntime of greatest vulnerability and uncertainty for au pairs occurs \nafter sponsors determine that irreconcilable differences exist between \na host family and the au pair who had been placed in their home. In \nmany such instances, it may not be clear if the irreconcilable \ndifference were caused by the behaviors/actions of the host family, au \npair, both, or neither. The Department of State relies on sponsor \norganizations to work with involved parties to reach a resolution. \nProgram sponsors have a detailed understanding of each au pair \nplacement and are the mediators between the parties. If a sponsor \ncannot reach a resolution acceptable to all parties, the Department of \nState will monitor any incidents or complaints until a resolution is \nreached, ensuring there is no retaliation by any party and allowing au \npairs to file complaints to any local, state, or federal enforcement \nagency. The rematch of an au pair with a new host family involves many \ncompeting interests. The original host family is seeking continued \nchild care pursuant to a contract with the sponsor. They may have \nalready paid the educational stipend and perhaps given their au pair \ntwo weeks' paid time off. The sponsor may seek to minimize its costs \nwhen finding new matches for both the host family and the au pair. The \nau pair is seeking a continued cultural and educational experience. The \nhost family may not be willing or able to keep the au pair in their \nhome until a new host family can be arranged.\n    To address the issues surrounding au pair rematching, the \nDepartment of State is proposing that sponsors develop and implement \nstandard operating procedures that address the range of circumstances \nthat may evolve when an au pair leaves a host family home. The major \nissues associated with rematching generally can be assigned to one of \nthe following categories: (1) where an au pair will live after leaving \nthe host family home and who is responsible for expenses incurred \nduring this transition period; (2) how to equitably split between the \nold and new host families the cost of the educational stipend and the \nbenefits of paid time off for weekends, vacation, and sick leave; (3) \nthe process sponsors follow to find new placements for au pairs; and, \n(4) the process and criteria for determining whether an au pair cannot \nbe rematched and must end the program early. Each of these situations \nis discussed separately below.\n    When a sponsor determines that an au pair is not suited for the \ncurrent placement, the Department of State's first concern is that the \nsponsor's standard operating procedures cover where the au pair will \nlive and who will be responsible for living expenses (i.e., food and \nlodging) at no additional cost to the au pair until the au pair is \nplaced with a new host family or returns home prior to the original \nprogram end date (proposed paragraph (c)(1)(iii)). Also, if an au pair \ncan only be rematched with a family in a different geographical \nlocation, the issue of which party is responsible for the cost of \ntransportation to the new location must be part of a sponsor's standard \noperating procedures. As proposed in paragraph (c)(1)(viii), sponsors \nmust establish standard operating procedures and processes for handling \nissues, complaints, and emergencies during routine monitoring, as well \nas written concerns by au pairs or host families.\n    Individuals seeking to become au pairs anticipate positive \nexperiences, so it may not occur to them that they could face several \ndays or weeks after leaving a host family home when their wages stop, \nbut their need for food and/or lodging does not. Sponsors would be \nrequired to develop plans to cover such situations and inform \napplicants of these plans before accepting them into their programs. Au \npairs not eligible for a rematch should be assisted immediately in \nreturning to their home country.\n    The Department of State is proposing a new paragraph (c)(3) on \nvetting foreign third parties, beyond what is required in Sec.  \n62.9(f). Proposed paragraph (c)(3)(ii) provides that sponsors would \nannually review and maintain specific documentation for foreign third \nparties (i.e., proof of business license, disclosure of legal actions, \nsummary of exchange program experience, marketing materials, and \nfinancial statements). Sponsors would also implement standard operating \nprocedures and internal controls to ensure that foreign entities comply \nwith the terms of such agreements.\n\n[[Page 74075]]\n\nHost Family Eligibility\n\n    As with the proposed rule for local coordinators, proposed \nparagraph (h) provides that host family members must not be a relative \nto the au pair and the host family commits not to reside outside of the \nUnited States and its territories for longer than a cumulative total of \n30 days or at a domestic location within the United States that is more \nthan one hour's drive from a local coordinator for longer than a \ncumulative total of 30 days during the au pair's program. Au pairs make \nthe commitment to a host family placement in the United States for one \nyear and would not be required to reside outside the United States for \nmore than 30 days.\n\nOrientations\n\n    The proposed rule distinguishes between the orientation \nrequirements prior to departure and post-arrival for au pairs (Sec.  \n62.31(f)). There is also a proposed paragraph for host family \norientations (Sec.  62.31(i)). Proposed Sec.  62.31(f)(1)(i) would \nestablish that before au pairs depart their home countries, sponsors \n(or third parties acting on their behalf) must present to the au pairs \nan executed copy of the Host Family Agreement (if they do not already \nhave one in their possession). The entities that conduct the pre-\ndeparture orientation must ensure that the agreement is signed and \ninitialed by both parties. Au pairs would continue to not be permitted \nto travel to the United States without a fully executed agreement. \nSponsors would also be required to inform au pairs of the requirement \nthat they take with them either a pre-paid return airline ticket or a \npre-paid voucher equivalent to the cost of a return ticket to ensure \nthat they can fund their return trip home at the end of the program \n(proposed paragraph (f)(1)(iii)). As will be discussed infra, sponsors \nthat are unable to rematch qualified au pairs would be required to \nrefund to the au pair a portion of the cost of the return ticket, based \non the length of time the au pair participated in the program. This \nsection also maintains the requirement that au pairs be apprised of the \nrole that the au pair program plays in achieving U.S. foreign policy \nobjectives by exposing participants to U.S. values, customs, and norms. \nThey also must be advised of the importance of completing the \neducational component of their program.\n    Host family orientation is an important part of an au pair \nplacement because setting realistic expectations at the outset helps to \nensure a successful placement. The Department of State proposes to add \nseveral requirements to this paragraph. First, the proposed rule would \nspecify that host family orientations cannot take place until the \nplacement is secured and that all adult members of the household must \nparticipate in the orientation (proposed paragraph (i)(1)). Sponsors \nmay work with the host family on accommodations so that all members of \nthe household receive the orientation. The proposed regulation would \nalso identify certain documents that the sponsor (or local coordinator) \nmust provide and certain topics they must discuss. The documents a \nsponsor (or local coordinator) must present include the following: a \ncopy of the fully executed Host Family Agreement; a copy of Sec.  62.31 \nof the au pair regulations and any Department of State-issued brochures \nor letters regarding the au pair program; and a print-out of the \ncurrent page(s) from the Internal Revenue Service's website on the \ntopic of taxation of nonresident aliens. The link can be found at: \n<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxation-of-nonresident-aliens\">https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxation-of-nonresident-aliens</a>. The sponsor should focus a discussion around the \nfollowing topics: the purpose and intent of the au pair program and the \nfamily's role in achieving foreign policy objectives; cultural \ndifferences; all topics listed in the Host Family Agreement; the \nprocess of documenting au pair work hours; reporting problems and \nseeking assistance from the sponsor organization and/or the Department \nof State; the sponsor's obligation to ensure they provide the au pair a \nsafe, comfortable, and clean home environment; and the sponsor's \npolicies on reporting to the sponsor any material changes in family \ncircumstances or composition, as well as sponsor policies for when an \nau pair needs to rematch with a host family.\n    Any training that the au pair requires prior to the beginning of \ntheir exchange program shall be provided by the sponsor as proposed in \nSec.  62.31(g) and may be compensable under the Fair Labor Standards \nAct (FLSA) and/or applicable state and local law. See 29 CFR 785.27 \nthrough 31.\n\nProtections\n\n    The Department of State has included a new paragraph ``Au pair \nlimitations and protections'' in proposed Sec.  62.31(k) to ensure that \nthe au pair's time is balanced appropriately between personal time (for \npursuing educational and cultural activities) and child care time.\n    First, the Department of State would identify leave benefits to \nwhich an au pair is entitled, (e.g., adequate time off between child \ncare duty obligations for rest and guaranteed paid time off and sick \nleave). Such benefits would also apply to au pairs who have extended \ntheir programs, and the number of days of leave for extensions are \nscaled to match the length of the extension period. With respect to \npaid time off, host families would be required to grant the leave that \nthe au pair requests, so long as such request is made four weeks prior \nto the beginning of such leave. Of course, host families may be \nflexible and allow such leave if the au pair requests it with less lead \ntime.\n    At a minimum, sponsors would ensure that host families give au \npairs an uninterrupted eight-hour period of rest every 24 hours to \nensure adequate sleep and time away from duty (proposed paragraph \n(k)(1)(ii)). In addition, host families must give au pairs one and one-\nhalf consecutive days off (36 hours) each calendar week and one \ncomplete weekend (48 hours) off each calendar month. The Department of \nState is introducing sick leave into the au pair program at the rate of \n56 hours of paid sick leave for a 12-month program and a prorated \nnumber of sick leave hours for program extensions shorter than 12 \nmonths (proposed paragraph (k)(1)(iv)). If the need for sick leave is \nforeseeable, the request should be made seven days in advance. If the \nneed for sick leave is not foreseeable, the au pair should request \nleave as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the need for sick \nleave.\n    This rulemaking also proposes in Sec.  62.31(k)(1)(v) to provide 80 \nhours of paid time off (i.e., the equivalent of ten working days) for a \n12-month program, at a time the au pair requests. The host family must \npermit the au pair to take 40 hours of such leave in conjunction with a \n36- or 48-hour weekend. Additional guidance to sponsors in ensuring \ncompliance with the regulations include clarification that host \nfamilies cannot dictate when au pairs may take vacation and they may \nnot subtract any time off from the au pair's 80 hours leave time if the \nau pair joins a family vacation.\n    Further, the proposed rule would explicitly state that no host \nfamily may deprive an au pair of access to, or hold or withhold without \nthe au pair's permission, an au pair's identification papers (including \npassport and Social Security card), cellphone, flight tickets or other \ntravel documents, Form DS-2019, or other personal property, or prevent \ncommunication between an au pair and the sponsor or the Department of \nState at any time, and between the au pair and his or her family while \nthe au pair is not providing child care\n\n[[Page 74076]]\n\n(Sec.  62.31(k)(1)(vi)). Sponsors would be required to ensure that host \nfamilies provide au pairs a safe, comfortable, and clean home \nenvironment free from sexual harassment, exploitation, or any other \nform of abuse, and they must respect the au pair's privacy, including \nboth their personal living space and their personal belongings.\n    Sponsors would be explicitly required to ensure that host family \nmembers do not photograph or create a video recording (e.g., use a \nnanny-cam) of an au pair without prior and ongoing consent by the au \npair (proposed paragraph (k)(1)(viii)). Sponsors would also be required \nto ensure that host family members do not photograph or create a video \nrecording of an au pair's private bedroom or primary bathroom while the \nau pair occupies them. The au pair is expected to respect the privacy \nof the host family children and should not take or use photographs of \nthe children without parental consent.\n    The Department of State has created an exchange visitors' rights \nand protections trifold, which is available to all exchange visitors \nat: <a href=\"https://j1visa.state.gov/participants/current/other-resources\">https://j1visa.state.gov/participants/current/other-resources</a> (From \n<a href=\"http://j1visa.state.gov\">j1visa.state.gov</a>, navigate to Participants [rarr] Current J-1 visa \nholders [rarr] Other Resources [rarr] Participant Brochures).\n\nAu Pair Rematch to a New Host Family\n\n    Both Department of State and sponsor surveys indicate broad \nsatisfaction with the au pair program among current au pairs and \nalumni. Most au pairs return home with positive memories and long-\nlasting friendships. Difficulties arise, however, when either a host \nfamily or an au pair seeks a rematch due to irreconcilable differences. \nThe Department of State understands that there are certain \ncircumstances that demonstrate that an au pair should not be rematched \nwith a new family, (e.g., putting the children at risk; habitually \nbreaking program, sponsor, or house rules, or behaving in a manner that \ncould bring notoriety and disrepute to the Exchange Visitor Program). \nHowever, when au pairs should be rematched due to host family behavior, \nthe au pairs are at a disadvantage: it is often difficult for sponsors \nto place an au pair with a history of problems with a host family--even \nif the host family was the problematic party in the arrangement. These \nnew proposed regulations help protect au pairs seeking rematch by \nestablishing different sponsor obligations to au pairs concerning \nrematching and refunding depending upon whether a sponsor deems an au \npair to be qualified or unqualified for rematching.\n    First, as discussed above, sponsors would be required to establish \nstandard operating procedures they use to determine whether a displaced \nau pair is qualified for rematch. Sponsors would be required to share \nwith new au pairs during the post-arrival orientation at the onset of \ntheir programs the criteria that they use in making such a \ndetermination. Standard procedures will prevent sponsors from declaring \nthat an au pair that may be difficult to rematch is not qualified to be \nrematched. Sponsors screen both host families and au pairs for the \nprogram. It is the sponsors' responsibility to make certain that both \nparties have realistic expectations of what being or hosting an au pair \nentails. Au pairs bear significant costs, including air fare, to travel \nto the United States to participate in the Exchange Visitor Program. If \ncircumstances outside their control require that the sponsor find them \na new family, sponsors must have every incentive to find them a new \nplacement in an expedient, fair and good faith manner.\n    Next, sponsors would be explicitly required to report the need for \na rematch to the Department of State by the next business day as \noutlined in the paragraph (r)(2) and Sec.  62.13(d). As also discussed \nabove, the health, safety, and welfare of an exchange visitor is a \nprimary Department of State concern. Circumstances may prevent a \ndisplaced au pair from remaining in the host family home until sponsors \nrematch a qualified au pair or until sponsors end an au pair's program \n(if circumstances warrant such action) and the au pair returns home. \nWhen an au pair is removed from the host family's home, sponsors must \nreport this to the Department of State within the next business day and \npursuant to reporting requirements at paragraph (r)(2). In accordance \nwith Sec.  62.31(l)(1), sponsors would be required to end the au pair's \nprogram in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) \nif the sponsor determines that actions on the part of the au pair \ndemonstrate their unsuitability to be placed with a new host family. Au \npairs should return promptly home (using the return ticket or voucher, \nif they were required under sponsor policy to pay for one at the \nbeginning of the program). Otherwise, sponsors must ensure that a \nreturn flight has been secured.\n    Sponsors, however, have a greater responsibility to displaced au \npairs who are qualified to be rematched. As discussed above, sponsors \nwould be required to develop standard operating procedures for \nrematching qualified au pairs. Sponsors are responsible for ensuring \nthe au pairs have a safe place to live and enough money for basic \nliving expenses while they are awaiting a rematch. The Department of \nState recommends that sponsors establish a maximum period during which \nthey will attempt to rematch the au pair and after which, they will be \nresponsible for refunding a portion of all fees the au pair paid the \nsponsor, and the Department of State recommends that sponsors consider \nrefunding a portion of a foreign third-party fee at a proportion \ndetermined by the length of time they were on program. The Department \nof State recommends, but does not require, that sponsors pay to au \npairs the refunds due from any foreign third party and include \nreimbursement policies in their written agreement with such parties, \nkeeping in mind that au pairs returning home may have additional costs \nexpenses and could benefit from a prompt and total refund. Sponsors are \nreminded that the failure of their third parties to make full and \ntimely required refunds will be attributed to the sponsor. Such \nfinancial arrangements are best handled by sponsors and their third \nparties and should not involve the au pairs. The Department of State \nseeks comment on such refund policies from sponsors and third parties, \nincluding on whether sponsors should be required to pay to au pairs the \nrefunds due from any foreign third party.\n    When sponsors successfully rematch qualified au pairs, it is up to \nthe sponsors to work out with the new and prior host families the fair \nallocation of non-income benefits and the educational stipend, some \nportion of which the first family may have already provided the \ndeparting au pair. This is a business arrangement between sponsors and \neach host family, that by definition, should not involve the au pair. \nUnder the proposed rule, au pairs that have completed 75 percent of \ntheir initial program or are on six-, nine-, or 12-month extensions may \nnot request a rematch and are not entitled to any refund of fees paid \n(proposed paragraph (l)(4)).\n\nHours\n\n    The Department of State also proposes in Sec.  62.31(m) that the au \npair's hours and weekly schedule be outlined in the Host Family \nAgreement. Host families and au pairs would be required to discuss \nproposed changes, which the sponsor must approve and document. The \nhours of child care for which au pairs must be compensated is the \nmaximum number of child care hours permitted within the selected \nexchange program, unless the au pair has exceeded the maximum hours\n\n[[Page 74077]]\n\npermitted, in which case the au pair must also be compensated for those \nexcess hours (proposed paragraph (n)(1)). In all circumstances, the \nsponsor would be required to ensure the au pair is compensated for any \nhours worked, even if in excess of the maximum number of child care \nhours permitted. Even if au pairs work fewer hours, host families would \nbe required to pay them for 31 hours for a part-time program or 40 \nhours for a full-time program. Au pairs deserve to know the hours of \nchild care they are expected to provide and the amount of compensation \nthey will receive each week. Inconsistencies in hours may lead to \nissues in being able to pay their weekly expenses. The 40-hour maximum \nis a change from the current regulations at 22 CFR 62.31(a) and (j)(1), \nunder which one program allows au pairs to regularly provide up to 45 \nhours of child care a week.\n    The Department of State believes reducing the maximum weekly child \ncare hours for full-time au pairs has several benefits. While providing \nchild care is a crucial part of the au pair program, au pairs come to \nthe United States with a primary intent to engage in cultural exchange. \nReducing the weekly working hours from 45 to 40 can help to ensure that \nau pairs have adequate time for fulfilling the education requirement, \nexperience socializing in the community, and time for rest and leisure, \nwhich is important for their physical and mental well-being.\n    By reducing their maximum weekly working hours, au pairs may be \nable to better manage their workload and avoid the negative effects of \nchronic stress. More host families are now able to work remotely or \nhave flexible schedules, which may reduce the time they need au pairs \nto provide child care. Furthermore, reducing the weekly working hours \nof au pairs can help to improve the quality of care they provide to the \nhost family. Some host families (or potential host families) may \nrequire more child care hours than the new regulations would allow. The \nnumber of families interested in the au pair program may decline as \nfamilies may turn to other child care options. The Department of State \nrecognizes that more Americans and potential au pairs may forego the \ncultural exchange opportunities available through the au pair program, \nbut believes the reduction in maximum hours is necessary to the overall \nsuccess of the program.\n    As discussed elsewhere, an au pair may not work hours in excess of \ntheir program's maximum-hours limit except under very limited exigent \ncircumstances. In addition, the Department of State proposes to \nexplicitly prohibit ``unworked'' hours (i.e., the difference between an \nau pair's actual hours worked in a week and their program's maximum-\nhours limit) from being carried over to the next week to exceed the \nprogram's maximum-hours limit in that next week in proposed paragraph \n(m)(1)(ii). In other words, each workweek stands alone. The Department \nof State proposes to require host families and au pairs to track daily \nchild care hours in a sponsor-approved format.\n    The proposed rule would expressly prohibit au pairs from providing \nchild care between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. unless exigent \ncircumstances arise (proposed paragraph (m)(4)). The Department of \nState seeks comment on whether a compensation or other mechanism could \nsimilarly discourage host families from routinely failing to make \nalternative arrangements.\n    In addition to providing child care, au pairs participate in \nregular family activities and cultural experiences, such as going to \nrestaurants, movies, theme parks, museums, theatre/opera, concerts, and \nsporting events with family members The au pair regulations also \ncurrently require au pair sponsors to host a ``family day conference'' \nthat all au pairs and host families must attend at least once annually \n(current 22 CFR 62.31(i)(3) and proposed paragraph (p)(4)). This \nproposal would amend the regulations to include the required family day \nconference as part of the au pair's workday so that it will be counted \nfor purposes of the programs' maximum hours threshold. Relatedly, the \nDepartment of State proposes that the regulations be amended to clarify \nthat time spent with host families in which the au pair is entirely \nrelieved of all child care duties and voluntarily participating as a \nmember of the family (and free to use the time for their own purposes), \nnot as a caretaker, is not considered work hours. This would be \nconsistent with Department of Labor guidance regarding hours worked \nunder the FLSA for workers who provide similar services as au pairs. \nSee, e.g., 29 CFR 552.102(a), 29 CFR 785.23, and Wage and Hour Division \nFact Sheet #79D (available at <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/whdfs79d.pdf\">https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/whdfs79d.pdf</a>). Thus, time spent by an au pair \nvoluntarily attending a meal, movie, or sporting event with a host \nfamily, for example, and during which the au pair is entirely relieved \nfrom all child care duties, would not be work hours.\n\nCompensation\n\n    Stipends. The current compensation mechanism provides for a \nstandard weekly stipend based on the current 45-hour workweek, \nregardless of how many hours an au pair works. The minimum weekly \nstipend for au pairs is currently calculated by multiplying the current \nfederal minimum wage by 45 hours and then deducting a credit for room \nand board. This formula applies across the country, without taking into \naccount the geographically-specific variations in costs of living. \nNumerous states and localities have adopted minimum wage rates that \nexceed the federal FLSA minimum wage. Over the past few years, au pair \nand interest group confusion over and dissatisfaction with the current \ncompensation framework has resulted in nation-wide litigation.\n    As discussed below, the Department of State has previously \nexpressed the view that a nationwide approach to au pair compensation \nrequired a nationally uniform compensation formula based on the federal \nminimum wage and that the current regulations were intended to preempt \nand thus render inapplicable conflicting or otherwise inconsistent \nstate and local labor laws, including state and local minimum wage and \novertime pay requirements. However, the Department of State recognizes \nthat the context in which the au pair compensation formula was \nestablished in the mid-1990s is no longer appropriate and has \nconsidered potential alternatives during its ongoing review of the \ncategory. The Department of State's review of the Au pair category of \nthe Exchange Visitor Program has revealed that the federal minimum wage \nno longer provides sufficient compensation to au pairs placed in \ngeographic areas in which growing number of states and localities have \nadopted state or local minimum wages that exceed the federal minimum \nwage. Accordingly, the Department of State is proposing to modify the \nregulations to require the calculation of au pairs' weekly compensation \nto be based on the tier of the highest of the applicable federal, \nstate, or local minimum wage in the city/state of host family residence \nso that au pairs are paid at least the highest applicable minimum wage. \nUnder the proposed rule, sponsors would require host families to \nidentify their state and local minimum wages on their host family \napplication, rates which the sponsor should confirm. Sponsors would \nalso require host families to notify the sponsor if there is a change \nto the federal, state, or local minimum wage during the au pair's \nprogram, and if necessary, initiate an updated Host\n\n[[Page 74078]]\n\nFamily Agreement. The Department of State understands that some host \nfamilies may not be able to afford an au pair and may be priced out of \nthe program. Sponsor organizations could suffer negative business \nconsequences and revenue losses if the host family pool decreases and \nthus creates less demand for au pairs. Prospective au pairs may only be \ninterested in going to destinations in the United States with higher \nminimum wages, contributing to diminished diversity and equity in the \nprogram. Some stakeholders may prefer a single compensation formula. \nTherefore, the Department of State is seeking to simplify the \nadministration of the compensation structure and, as discussed later, \nseeks public comment on the delayed implementation of these and the \nother proposed revisions.\n    The Department of State is proposing to modify Sec.  62.31(n)(4) to \nreflect a four-tiered au pair compensation mechanism based on the \nhighest of the federal, state, or local minimum wage. The Department of \nState is not asserting that its proposed regulations would preempt \nstate and local minimum wage and overtime pay laws as they apply to au \npairs.\n    The Department of State proposes to adopt a national four-tiered \nwage formula to provide consistency in au pair compensation across \ngeographic regions and in areas with similar local economic conditions. \nThe proposed tiered compensation chart is as follows:\n\n               Table 1--Proposed Compensation Tiered Chart\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Based upon the host\n                          family city, the\n                        highest of federal,        Au pair receives\n                          state, or local\n                            minimum wage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTier 1...............  $7.25-$8.00 per hour.  $8 per hour.\nTier 2...............  $8.01-$12.00 per hour  $12 per hour.\nTier 3...............  $12.01-$15.00 per      $15 per hour.\n                        hour.\nTier 4...............  $15.01-$18.00 per      $18 per hour.*\n                        hour.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Or the applicable federal, state, or local minimum hourly wage, if\n  higher.\n\n    A four-tiered wage formula would also ease administrative burdens \nin regulating or overseeing au pair compensation when the relevant \nminimum wage changes within a tier. The maximum hourly wage an au pair \nwould receive is normally determined by the wage of the highest tier in \nthe compensation chart; however, if the federal, state, or local \ngovernment has a minimum hourly wage higher than the highest hourly \nrate on the chart, then the au pair must be paid that higher hourly \nwage.\n    The proposed rule would provide that the Department of State will \nperiodically, but no less than every three years (or at any shorter \ninterval that is desirable and feasible), update the hourly pay rates \nin the four-tiered au pair compensation chart by Federal Register \nnotice in response to changing economic conditions (e.g., if a state or \nlocality's minimum wage exceeds the highest tier). The increase will be \naccomplished by adjusting the upper range of each tier by an identical \namount each update cycle. For example, if the Department of State \nchooses in the first update cycle to increase the upper range of each \ntier by $2, the chart would read as follows:\n\n Table 2--Hypothetical Compensation Tiered Chart Adjustment Based Upon a\n                               $2 Increase\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Based upon the host\n                          family city, the\n                        highest of federal,        Au pair receives\n                        state, or local min\n                                wage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTier 1...............  $7.25-$10.00 per hour  $10 per hour.\nTier 2...............  $10.01-$14.00 per      $14 per hour.\n                        hour.\nTier 3...............  $14.01-$17.00 per      $17 per hour.\n                        hour.\nTier 4...............  $17.01-$20.00 per      $20 per hour.*\n                        hour.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Or the applicable federal, state, or local minimum hourly wage, if\n  higher.\n\n    Periodically updating the chart by Federal Register Notice is \nnecessary to provide the Department of State with flexibility to \nincrease the hourly pay rates in the compensation chart due to the \nuncertainty of future economic conditions.\n    Room and Board. The new regulations at Sec.  62.31(n)(2) address \nhost family deductions for au pairs' room and board. Host families must \ncalculate such deductions according to FLSA requirements. The \nDepartment of State currently permits au pair room and board deductions \nand proposes to maintain a policy in the proposed rule, as described in \nthe terms below.\n    Under section 3(m) of the FLSA (29 U.S.C. 203(m)), a credit toward \nthe federal minimum wages due an employee is permissible for meals, \nlodging, and other facilities, if certain requirements are met based on \nthe reasonable cost or fair value of the facilities furnished. The \nsection 3(m) credit may not exceed the ``reasonable cost'' or ``fair \nvalue'' of the facilities furnished, whichever is less. See 29 U.S.C. \n203(m). Reasonable cost is ``not more than the actual cost to the \nemployer of the board, lodging, or other facilities customarily \nfurnished by him to his employees.'' 29 CFR 531.3(a). Credits for room \nand board may be taken only when the employee actually receives the \nlodging and meals per 29 CFR 531.30.\n    The following amounts reflect permissible credits under the FLSA \ntowards an au pair's wages for Meals provided (per day):\n\nBreakfast Up to 37.5% of the minimum wage = $2.72\nLunch Up to 50.0% of the minimum wage = $3.63\nDinner Up to 62.5% of the minimum wage = $4.53\nTotals: = $10.88 per day\n7 days x $10.88 = $76.16 per week for meals credit.\n\n    The following amount is a permissible credit under the FLSA towards \nan au pair's wages for Lodging provided (per week):\n    Up to seven and one-half times the federal minimum wage for each \nweek.\n\n7.5 x $7.25 = $54.38 per week for Lodging credit.\n\n    Pursuant to 29 CFR 552.100, the total permissible credit towards an \nau pair's wages per week for a full seven days of room and board \nactually provided is: $76.16 (meals) + $54.38 (lodging) = $130.54.\n\n[[Page 74079]]\n\n    Calculation of weekly permissible room and board credits does not \ndepend on whether the au pair is full-time or part-time or which wage \ntier determines the au pair's hourly rate or whether the au pair is \npaid overtime that week. The credit is determined based on the meals \nand lodging actually provided to the au pair during the week and is \nthen subtracted from the wages otherwise due the au pair for that week. \nTo the extent that a state or locality permits only a smaller credit \nfor au pairs than permissible credits under the FLSA discussed above, \nthe state or local law or regulation permitting only such smaller \ndeductions would be preempted by these regulations (proposed paragraph \n(t)).\n    Overtime. When part-time au pairs work more than 31 hours in a week \nbut not more than 40 hours, the Department of State proposes to require \nau pairs to be compensated for those excess hours at the hourly rate of \nthe applicable tier identified in paragraph (n)(4)(ii) of the \nregulations or the highest of the applicable federal, state, or local \nminimum wage, if higher. When part-time or full-time au pairs work over \n40 hours in a week, the Department of State proposes to require au \npairs shall be compensated for those excess hours at the hourly rate of \nthe applicable tier identified in paragraph (n)(4)(ii) of the \nregulations or the highest of the applicable federal, state, or local \nminimum wage if higher, and they must also be paid any overtime premium \ndue under applicable federal, state, or local law (proposed paragraph \n(n)(4)(iv)). In addition, the proposed rule would require au pairs must \nbe paid any other overtime premiums due under applicable federal, \nstate, or local law for other hours worked. These regulations would not \npreempt state and local laws regarding overtime pay as host families \nare discouraged from requiring au pairs to work additional hours in \ncontravention of program policies and regulatory requirements.\n    The Department of State encourages public comment on this \nalternative calculation of au pairs' compensation and welcomes other \nproposals of alternative calculations that maintain a uniform national \nstipend formula that accommodates variations in federal, state, and \nlocal minimum wage rates. Any viable proposal must remain true to the \ncore objective of all international exchanges conducted pursuant to the \nFulbright-Hays Act, i.e., to serve as a cultural program designed to \nmeet the crucial foreign policy goal of enhancing mutual understanding \nbetween people of our nation and other nations.\n    Assuming adherence to the programs' maximum hours provisions, the \nregulations would continue to not permit week-to-week variation in the \nstipend amount (although there may be week-to-week variation in the \ncredit taken for lodging and meals actually provided) since, as \ndiscussed above, stipends are based on the maximum weekly hours \nestablished for the part-time and full-time program options. However, \nmaintenance of a weekly record of hours, payment, and deductions would \nbe required to provide sponsors with documentation to demonstrate that \nhost families are complying with important regulatory requirements. \nSponsors would be required to review such documentation to confirm that \nau pairs are working only the required hours, are provided their paid \ntime off, and are charged for in-kind benefits (e.g., gym membership, \ncell phones) only as the au pair and host family agreed in the Host \nFamily Agreement and only as permitted by paragraph (n)(3) of the \nproposed regulations. The Department of State seeks comment on this \nproposed method of documenting that host families do not require au \npairs to exceed the maximum number of child care hours each day or week \nand that they compensate au pairs (with income and non-income benefits, \ne.g., leave) in accordance with the regulations.\n    The proposed rule would require sponsors to ensure that host \nfamilies provide au pairs copies of this tracking document on a weekly \nbasis throughout the exchange program (paragraph (m)(6)(ii)). Further, \nsponsor organizations would be required to collect and review copies of \nthe timesheets each month. Such review may be conducted by field or \nheadquarters staff, and sponsors are reminded of their obligation to \nretain copies of all weekly documents timesheets for three years \nfollowing the end of the au pair's program in accordance with Sec.  \n62.10(g).\n\nEducational Component\n\n    Because completion of this portion of an au pair program is \ncritical for achieving the objectives of the Fulbright-Hays Act, the \nDepartment of State proposes four alternative types of educational \nprograms to provide more flexibility to facilitate au pairs' pursuit of \nthis requirement. The Department of State seeks comment on these or \nother similar alternatives, especially with respect to the required \nnumber of hours for each option and whether the new, higher educational \nstipend is sufficient given current and perhaps geographically-\ndependent costs of education.\n    The regulations retain the traditional academic option currently \nset forth at 62.31(k) for those au pairs who are seeking the \nopportunity to advance their academic education while on program by \nobtaining a minimum of six semester hours at an accredited U.S. \nacademic institution. It should be noted that the academic option being \nproposed in paragraph (o)(1) is the only one that may have a virtual \ncomponent. Au pairs would have the option of attending in-person \nclasses or taking a subset of classes online during their program. In-\nperson exchanges are still a critical component of the Exchange Visitor \nProgram and ensure that au pairs have a chance to be exposed to \nAmericans outside of the host family. Thus, the Department of State \nproposes, under paragraph (o)(1)(i)(A), to permit au pairs pursing the \nacademic option to complete no more than one third of the required \ncoursework online if local circumstances permit.\n    Not all individuals have academic goals, however, and the interests \nof some au pairs may be better met through continuing education \nprograms. Accordingly, the Department of State has proposed to allow \ncoursework at continuing educational institutions (Sec.  62.31(o)(2)) \nas sufficient for meeting the educational component requirement.\n    In the past, the Department of State has rejected au pair \nattendance at, for example, weekend courses at a campus setting that \nare attended exclusively by au pairs. While this option allows au pairs \nto interact with one another, it does not provide the opportunity to \nmingle primarily with U.S. students. However, after further \nconsideration, the Department of State recognizes that courses that are \ncustomized for the au pair community offer other distinct benefits. \nSponsors and the academic institutions with which they jointly design \nsuch courses have the opportunity to develop a curriculum that \nhighlights U.S. history and values, e.g., rule of law, civil rights, \nand democratic values. Such concentrated exposure to the U.S. culture \ncan provide au pairs with a relevant and focused cultural and \nhistorical overview that is not available through traditional academic \nand educational institutions. Accordingly, the Department of State \nproposes and seeks comment on this option (Sec.  62.31(o)(3)).\n    Depending upon the geographic location where an au pair is placed, \nthere may be limited options for academic and/or continuing education \nopportunities. As volunteerism is a U.S.\n\n[[Page 74080]]\n\nvalue, the Department of State offers an option that allows au pairs to \nfulfill half their educational requirement by volunteering with a tax-\nexempt nonprofit organization as described in section 501(c)(3) of the \nU.S. Internal Revenue Code (Sec.  62.31(o)(4)). This provides \nadditional flexibility from both a time perspective and by \naccommodating the various interests of exchange visitors. The other \nhalf of the component may be met by pursuing either academic coursework \nor continuing education classes. The Department of State seeks comments \non all these options and welcomes comments on additional ways of \nmeeting the educational component requirement.\n    The Department of State recognizes that the cost of education has \nincreased significantly over the years and that an increase in the \neducational stipend amount is long overdue. The current regulations \nrequire host families to pay $500 towards the au pair's six semester \nhours of education. The Department of State is proposing to increase \nthe stipend paid by host families to $1,200. The review of several two-\nyear or community colleges averaged $130 per credit hour x six credit \nhours, plus cost of registration, books, etc. The Department of State \nseeks comment as to whether the increase to $1,200 is sufficient to \ncover most of the educational expense au pairs will incur (Sec.  \n62.31(o)(6)).\\2\\ Host families may pay the stipend either directly to \nthe au pair or to the appropriate institution. As discussed above, in \ncase of a rematch, the Department of State expects sponsors to arrange \nthe equitable distribution of the stipend cost between the host \nfamilies without involving the au pair. Sponsors must also be prepared \nto ensure that an au pair that is part-way through a course and is \nrematched to a new geographical location has sufficient resources to \nreenroll in classes at the new locale.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/cost-of-a-college-class-or-credit-hour\">https://educationdata.org/cost-of-a-college-class-or-credit-hour</a> (suggesting the average cost of a credit hour at a community \ncollege or in-district school is $141 per credit hour); <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-cost-per-credit-hour\">https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-cost-per-credit-hour</a> (``Two-\nyear public schools, or community colleges, charge the least at just \nunder $120 per credit hour.'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As with paid time off and sick leave, the number of education hours \nau pairs must complete during any extension period would vary, as they \ndo now, based upon the length of the program extension. The Department \nof State seeks comment on the four options, the required compensation \namounts, and the number of hours that should be required for extensions \n(recognizing that extension periods may not always line up with \ninstitutions' course schedules). The Department of State intends for \nthe hour commitment among the four options to be substantially the same \nand seeks comment on whether its proposed hourly requirements achieve \nthis goal.\n\nReporting\n\n    The Department of State proposes to require third party vetting and \nreporting similar to that currently required under the Summer Work \nTravel program. Au pair sponsors would be required to vet all foreign \nthird parties as defined in Sec.  62.2 (e.g., overseas agents or \npartners) that assist them in fulfilling the program responsibilities \nunder Sec.  62.10 that may be conducted outside the United States. Such \nvetting would include reviewing and documenting previous bankruptcies \nor pending legal actions, summaries of the entities' prior J-1 Exchange \nVisitor visa experience, and copies of sponsor-approved advertising \nmaterials. After sponsors have successfully vetted foreign third \nparties, they would be required to provide the Department of State with \nthat third party's name and contact information (i.e., telephone \nnumber, email address, street address, city address, point of contact, \nand website address) within 30 days of execution of the agreement by \nproviding the Department of State with a Foreign Entity Report. The \nsponsor also must provide the Department of State with updated contact \ninformation for its foreign third party within 30 days after receiving \nnotice of any change in that party's contact information. Although \nsponsors do not need to work with foreign third parties, they may not \nwork with those foreign third parties that are not included in the \nForeign Entity Report. If any material information (e.g., contact \ninformation, financial status, relationship with sponsor) changes, \nsponsors must provide this information to the Department of State \nwithin 30 days.\n    The foreign third parties' initial outreach to potential program \napplicants sets the stage for participants' expectations about the au \npair program. Sponsors must be aware of what the foreign third parties \nare posting on websites, communicating through social media, and \ndistributing in printed materials to ensure the information conforms to \nthe purpose and intent of the program and meets regulatory \nrequirements. It is important, for example, that the cultural exchange \naspects of the program are accentuated, and that au pair applicants' \nexpectations about hours and compensation are realistic.\n    In addition, to better manage expectations and provide au pair \nprogram applicants and selected au pairs with greater transparency \nregarding the fees they may be charged to participate in the program, \nthe Department of State is adding a requirement that sponsors submit a \nlist of all fees, including recruitment fees or associated costs, that \neither they or their foreign third parties may charge applicants to \napply for and participate in the program. Such list must describe the \nservices associated with each fee and clarify whether the fees are \nestimated or fixed, refundable or non-refundable, and mandatory or \noptional.\n    In 2014, the Department of State extended the management review \nrequirement to other categories of the Exchange Visitor Program. The \nDepartment of State is keeping the current regulatory language \nrequiring a report by a certified public accountant until Sec.  \n62.15(b) of subpart A (General Provisions) is updated. The only \nproposed change is to add language in which the Department of State \nwill release a schedule approved by the Department of State for \nsubmission of the report.\n\nPreservation of Additional Features of the Au Pair Category\n\n    As previously explained, the Exchange Visitor Program is first and \nforemost a diplomatic tool that supports U.S. foreign policy \nobjectives. Accordingly, a number of program features set forth in the \nregulations are key to the program's operation as a diplomatic tool. \nGiven the Department of State's exercise of its discretion under the \nFulbright-Hays Act in arriving at this balance, the Department of State \nis also proposing to amend the federal au pair regulations to provide \nexplicitly that the regulations establish the exclusive requirements \napplicable to host families and sponsors on certain matters and may not \nbe supplemented by state or local law. As proposed in paragraph (t)(1), \nthese key program features must not be supplemented or contravened by \nstate or local law, namely: (a) au pair selection; (b) au pair \nplacement; (c) hours and compensation (except for state and local \nminimum wage and overtime pay requirements, as described below); (d) \nunemployment insurance tax and employment training taxes; (e) minimum \ntime off and paid time off and sick leave; and, (f) educational \ncomponent. These elements all work in concert to create a program that \nmeets foreign policy goals of establishing mutual understanding through \ncultural exchange and emphasizes the value of the au pair's\n\n[[Page 74081]]\n\nintegration with an American family even when not providing child care. \nThe Department of State also proposes in paragraph (t)(2) that \nregulatory framework provided under this section shall preempt any \nstate or local law that, in the Department of State's view, otherwise \nposes an obstacle to the realization of the objectives of the Au pair \ncategory of the Exchange Visitor Program. Notwithstanding the \nforegoing, state and local minimum wage and overtime pay requirements \nshall apply to au pairs where applicable and shall not be deemed to be \nan obstacle to achievement of the objectives of the Au pair category of \nthe Exchange Visitor Program.\n    Au pair programs operate in the field of foreign affairs, an area \nthat has long been reserved to the U.S. Federal Government. In 1985, \nand by statute, Congress authorized the Director of the U.S. \nInformation Agency to provide for au pair programs. In 1994, Congress \ndirected the U.S. Information Agency to continue the au pair program \nwithin the Exchange Visitor Program and to prescribe regulations \ngoverning it (see Pub. L. 103-415, 1, 108 Stat. 4299, 4302 (1994)). \nCongress has since further extended the program and made it permanent \nin 1997 (see Pub. L. 105-48, 111 Stat. 1165 (1997)). In so doing, \nCongress believed this distinctly federal program would further the \nUnited States' objectives in the areas of foreign relations and \ninternational diplomacy, two areas ``inherently federal in character.'' \nBuckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Comm., 531 U.S. 341, 374 (2001). The \nExchange Visitor Program ``originates from, is governed by, and \nterminates according to federal law.'' Id. When the Fulbright-Hays Act \nauthorized educational and cultural exchanges, the Act also created ``a \nnew nonimmigrant visa, category (J), to serve solely the purposes of \nthe Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961.'' H. R. Rep. \nNo. 1197, at 17 (1961) (Conf. Rep.). The federal regulations provide \nthe exclusive terms under which an au pair exchange visitor may enter \nthe country, as the ``[p]ower to regulate immigration is unquestionably \nexclusively a federal power.'' De Canas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 354 \n(1976).\n    The Department of State is proposing to expressly preempt state and \nlocal law in the areas of au pair selection, au pair placement, and the \neducational component. Congress has authorized the Department to create \na federal international exchange program that brings young adults into \nthe country for an educational and cultural experience. The Department \nof State balances the needs of au pairs, sponsors, and host families \nand their communities in these regulations when it determines the \neligibility and placement terms that best advance the foreign policy \nand diplomatic objectives of the federal government. Contrary state \nrules in these areas would upend that well-considered approach.\n    In addition, the Department of State is proposing to preempt state \nand local law in the areas of hours and compensation (except for state \nand local minimum wage and overtime pay requirements, as described \nbelow) and minimum time off and paid time off vacation and sick leave. \nAs discussed supra, the Department of State has previously expressed \nthe view that a nationwide approach to au pair compensation required a \nnationally uniform compensation formula. The Department of State \nrecognizes that the federal minimum wage no longer provides sufficient \ncompensation to au pairs, and that a significant number of states and \nlocalities have adopted state or local minimum wages that exceed the \nfederal minimum wage. Accordingly, the Department of State is proposing \nto modify the regulations to require the calculation of au pairs' \nweekly compensation to be based on the tier of the highest of the \napplicable federal, state, or local minimum wage in the city/state of \nhost family residence so that au pairs are paid at least the highest \napplicable minimum wage. The Department of State also proposes to \nreduce maximum weekly hours of child care to forty hours and remove the \novertime option, with the exception of limited exigent circumstances. \nState and local law related to room and board deductions would be \npreempted to preserve a uniform compensation scheme. With this federal \nstructure in place, the au pair program would continue to operate on a \nnationwide uniform basis for hours and compensation while not \npreempting state and local minimum wage and overtime pay requirements. \nThe Department of State would not preempt state and local laws \nregarding overtime pay as host families are discouraged from requiring \nau pairs to work additional hours in contravention of program policies \nand regulatory requirements.\n    Under paragraph (t)(1)(d), the Department of State proposes to \npreempt all state unemployment insurance taxes and the employment \ntraining taxes described below. In addition to carving out a new visa \ncategory, the Fulbright-Hays Act amended the Internal Revenue Code \nrelating to the definition of employment for purposes of Federal \nInsurance Contributions Act (FICA) contributions and the Federal \nUnemployment Tax Act. Section 110(e) of the Fulbright-Hays Act exempts \nexchange visitors from paying FICA taxes on services authorized by the \nprogram, since they are ``temporarily'' in the United States and \n``scarcely have any expectation of realizing benefits from such a tax \npayment.'' See H. R. Rep. No. 1197, at 19. Section 110(f) removes the \nobligation of employers to pay Federal unemployment tax on certain \nauthorized exchange visitor services.\\3\\ The Conference Report notes \nthat ``exchange visitors could rarely, if ever, be in a position to \nbenefit from unemployment compensation coverage.'' Id. Congress crafted \na nuanced approach to exchange programs to further U.S. foreign policy \nobjectives, distinguishing exchange visitor programs from temporary \nemployment programs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The exemptions from FICA taxes and Federal unemployment tax \nunder section 110 of the Fulbright-Hays Act were codified in \nsections 3121(b)(19) and 3306(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code, \nrespectively. These exemptions apply to the extent that the exchange \nvisitors are nonresident aliens. An exchange visitor who has \npreviously been in the United States on temporary nonimmigrant \nstatus as a student, teacher, trainee, or researcher under \nsubparagraph (F), (J), (M), or (Q) of 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) could be \na resident alien during their current stay in the United States and, \ntherefore, may be subject to FICA taxes and Federal unemployment tax \nif their annual wages exceed the applicable dollar threshold. See 26 \nU.S.C. 3121(b)(19), 3306(c)(19), and 7701(b), and 26 CFR \n31.3121(b)(19)-1(a)(1) and 31.3306(c)(18)-1(a)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Under paragraph (t)(1)(d), the Department of State proposes to \npreempt all state unemployment insurance taxes and the employment \ntraining taxes described below. Under Federal law, compensation paid to \nau pairs is often deemed to be exempt from the requirement that \nemployers pay Federal unemployment taxes on their wages. The exact \nconditions for determining when the wages may be subject to Federal \nunemployment tax can be found by consulting the IRS website on au \npairs, in addition to Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide.\n    In most cases, au pairs, who are between the age of 18 to 26, come \nto the United States to participate for the first time in an au pair \nprogram and are required to return home once they successfully complete \nthe program. As the au pair program does not provide work authorization \nafter the program ends, an au pair would not be eligible for \nunemployment benefits unless they obtained other authorization to work \nin the United States beyond the au pair program, and payment of\n\n[[Page 74082]]\n\nunemployment taxes on these wages would not be the responsibility of \nthe au pair `s host family. Therefore, the Department of State does not \nexpect host families to be required to pay state or local unemployment \ninsurance taxes or the employment training taxes described below.\n    Unemployment insurance is a joint state-federal program that \nprovides cash benefits to eligible workers. States have various types \nof unemployment tax requirements that may require employers to pay a \npayroll tax, also known as a State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA) tax. \nStates use funds to pay out unemployment insurance benefits to \nunemployed workers. States might also refer to SUTA tax as State \nunemployment insurance, SUI tax, or Reemployment tax (e.g., Florida). \nIn most states, unemployment insurance is an employer-only tax. \nHowever, employees in certain states (e.g., Alaska, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania) must also pay an unemployment insurance tax.\n    Some states have an employment training tax, which generally \nprovides funds to train employees in targeted industries, teach workers \nnew skills, and promote businesses to make businesses more competitive. \nLike unemployment insurance, employment training taxes are paid by \nemployers and businesses. States refer to employment training taxes \nusing different terms, such as an Employment & Training Investment \nAssessment (e.g., Texas). In any case, the assessment is imposed on \neach employer as a percentage of wages paid by an employer. As \ndiscussed above, au pairs do not have general work authorization, and \nonce their exchange program ends, are expected to return home. \nTherefore, employment training taxes do little to protect or benefit au \npairs. In addition, the Department of State is aware of the cumulative \ncosts of this rulemaking on prospective host families and seeks to \nbroaden the pool of interested host families as much as possible. The \nDepartment of State is concerned about burdening au pair programs with \nthe payment of additional general welfare taxes so as to further \nrestrict affordability of the program to the most wealthy host \nfamilies. For these reasons, the Department of State proposes to \nexpressly preempt state or local laws related to employment training \ntaxes.\n    If state and local laws interfere with the fulfillment of the au \npair program in a capacity that frustrates Congressional objectives and \nthe President's foreign affairs prerogatives, the Department of State \nmay choose to regulate to reflect the preemption of state and local \nlaw. The Department of State proposes this rulemaking to affirm the \nexclusivity of Federal regulation over the au pair program in certain \nareas expressly identified in proposed paragraph (t) that could \nfrustrate the primacy of the Federal Government in the conduct of \nforeign affairs and immigration if such matters were regulated by the \nStates.\n    In doing so, the proposed rule is consistent with the ruling in \nCapron v. Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, 944 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2019). The First Circuit noted in \nthe Capron decision that the Department of State ``would be free to \npreempt . . . [the relevant] state laws now by revising the \nregulations.'' Id. at 44.\n    In that case, the Department of State advanced its view that the \nexisting Federal au pair regulations already preempt state and local \nlaws pertaining to the terms of employment in the au pair program. The \nau pair program is a creation of Federal law and operates in the \nspheres of foreign affairs and immigration, two areas that have been \nexclusively reserved to the Federal Government. The Department of State \nargued that the requirement that Responsible Officers of programs with \nan employment component have a ``detailed knowledge of federal, state, \nand local laws pertaining to employment'' did not indicate otherwise. \nThe Department of State has an important policy interest in ensuring \nthat applicable state or local law with respect to matters not \naddressed by Federal regulations continues to protect participants in \nthe program. While Capron dealt with whether Federal regulations \npreempt Massachusetts from requiring host families to comply with \nvarious state laws, the Department of State believes its arguments \nwould have applied with equal, if not greater, force in the context of \npreemption of state law directed at sponsors. The Department of State \nargued that the regulations provide a comprehensive framework for the \nterms of employment in the program, leaving no room for state law \nwhether applied to host families or sponsors.\n    Nevertheless, the First Circuit decision in Capron concluded that \nFederal au pair regulations do not, as currently written, preempt state \nand local law, and this has led to a great deal of confusion among au \npair sponsor organizations, au pairs, host families, and state/local \ngovernments about the relationship between the Federal au pair \nregulations and state and local law. Indeed, this ruling has caused an \nimmediate negative impact on the au pair program. Families inviting an \nau pair into their home to share a cultural exchange experience incur \nsignificant personal and financial burdens; predictable program \nrequirements are necessary for families to make this decision. \nUncertainty about whether Federal or State/local law requirements \napply, or how these provisions apply simultaneously, has made it \nextremely difficult for the families to anticipate their \nresponsibilities, costs, administrative burdens, and ultimately their \nability to host an au pair. The proliferation of additional lawsuits \nconcerning the au pair program in the wake of the Capron decision has \nonly added to this uncertainty. In addition, families that were \nadhering to the Federal regulations in good faith may now find \nthemselves accused of violating state and local laws and facing legal \nexposure.\n    In addition to the minimum wage issue discussed above, the proposed \nrule would clarify the calculation of the room and board deduction \nunder the FLSA. The requirements that an au pair live with an American \nhost family and participate directly in home life, and the availability \nof the deduction to the host family, are key features of the au pair \nprogram because they facilitate the au pair's participation in daily \nfamily life, entertainment, and meals. Similarly, in order to help \nbuild strong relationships with their American host families, au pairs \nare not permitted under the au pair regulations to provide child care \nfor multiple families (proposed in paragraph (e)(1)(v)) or work for any \nother employer, whereas states/localities may permit a domestic worker \nto work for multiple employers. The Federal regulations for the au pair \nprogram offer other nationwide benefits and protections to au pairs \nincluding the requirement that au pairs be given certain time off and \ntwo weeks of paid time off.\n    Under the First Circuit ruling in Capron, it is unclear to host \nfamilies what obligations they have that extend beyond those provided \nin the current au pair regulations. As a result, sponsors have reported \na decrease in prospective host families interested in participating in \nthe program. One sponsor notified the Department of State that they no \nlonger would place au pairs or run their exchange program in the state \nof Massachusetts. Data from the SEVIS reports that there were 1,457 au \npairs placed in Massachusetts in 2019. The number of au pairs has \ndeclined each year since the ruling. In 2021 and 2022, there were 528 \nand 454 au pairs respectively placed in Massachusetts. The prospect of \nlitigation in other jurisdictions and interest in new state and local \nlaw measures to regulate the\n\n[[Page 74083]]\n\nterms of au pair employment has dramatically increased. The Department \nof State believes it is urgent to bring clarity to this issue by \npromulgating this rulemaking, and thereby preserving a nationwide \napproach to the au pair program and facilitating a cultural exchange \nprogram experience that meets U.S. foreign policy objectives.\n\nSeverability\n\n    The Department of State proposes to include a severability clause \nin Sec.  62.31(u), such that if any provision is held invalid or \nunenforceable, it would not affect the remainder of the rule. The \nDepartment of State believes that the provisions of this rulemaking are \nnecessary to further the foreign affairs and diplomacy purposes of the \nFulbright-Hays Act. To the extent that any provision is held invalid or \nunenforceable, the Department of State intends for the remaining \nprovisions to continue to operate and protect au pairs, sponsors, and \nother stakeholders in the au pair program.\n    Proposed Sec.  62.31(u) would establish that in the event that any \nprovision of this section is held invalid as applied to any person or \ncircumstance, the Department of State intends for such provision to be \nconstrued to have maximum effect as applied to other persons or \ncircumstances to the extent permitted under law. If such provision is \ndeemed invalid and unenforceable in any circumstance, the Department of \nState intends for such provision to be severable from the remaining \nprovisions of this section.\n\nReliance Interests\n\n    The Department of State recognizes that sponsors, host families, au \npairs, and their communities may have reliance interests of varying \ndegrees in the current au pair program. The Department of State \nunderstands that sponsors may have relied upon the current regulations \nin deciding to seek designation to conduct exchange programs; in hiring \nstaff and recruiting potential exchange visitors; and in making other \nbusiness choices. Au pair sponsors invest a significant amount of time \nand resources into recruiting and selecting host families and au pairs. \nAny sudden changes to the program regulations could disrupt this \ninvestment and cause significant uncertainty and stress for sponsors, \nhost families, and au pairs. The Department of State is aware that this \nrulemaking may decrease the number of au pairs participating in sponsor \nprograms, but the Department believes that the benefits of reducing \nconfusion about the relationship between the Federal au pair \nregulations and state and local law will help to increase \nparticipation. Further, the rulemaking includes a number of safeguards \nfor au pairs and host families that may also increase participation and \nultimately benefit sponsors. Nonetheless, as discussed below, the \nDepartment of State proposes to delay the effective date of the final \nrule for approximately six months to allow sponsors time to reevaluate \ntheir programs before the new regulations go into effect.\n    The Department of State has also considered the effect of this \nproposed rule on families that are currently hosting au pairs. Host \nfamilies may have decided to participate in an exchange program under \nthe existing rules and unexpectedly face new costs if subject to the \nnew regulations immediately. The effects on host families will include \npaying more than twice as much in au pair compensation as they \ncurrently do in some localities. In consideration of these reliance \ninterests, the Department of State proposes to ``grandfather'' au pairs \n(and their host families) on exchange programs that began prior to the \nfinal rule's effective date, (i.e., 180 days from publication of the \nfinal rule). Such exchange programs will not be subject to the new \nrules for the duration of the initial one-year program, or for up to \none year if the au pair is currently on an extension. Current host \nfamilies that intended to extend participation of their current au pair \nwill be subject to the new regulations 180 days after publication of \nthe final rule. Some host families may choose not to extend their au \npair's program as a result. The Department of State nonetheless \nbelieves the benefits of greater protections for au pairs and host \nfamilies will lead to an improvement in the public diplomacy benefits \nof the program. The Department of State requests comments on its \nconsideration of the reliance interests of stakeholders.\n    Implementation. Given the significant impact the proposed rule will \nhave on host families and au pairs that have already signed a Host \nFamily Agreement, the Department of State proposes to ``grandfather'' \ncertain au pair programs that begin prior to the effective date of 180 \ndays from date of publication of the final rule. If the Department \nfinalizes all or part of this proposal, au pair exchange programs with \na Program Begin Date on the DS-2019 prior to 180 days from date of \npublication of the final rule are subject to the requirements of 22 CFR \n62.31 in effect at the time of the Program Begin Date on Form DS-2019. \nAny extensions of programs authorized prior to the effective date of \n180 days from date of publication of the final rule are also subject to \nthe requirements of 22 CFR 62.31 in effect at the time of the Program \nBegin Date. Any program extensions authorized on or after the effective \ndate of 180 days from date of publication of the final rule would be \nsubject to the requirements set forth in this section.\n    The Department of State also seeks comment on its proposal to delay \nthe effective date of the final rule for 180 days upon publication of a \nfinal rule; as well as comment on any provisions of proposed Sec.  \n62.31 that should be implemented sooner, (e.g., within 30 days of \npublication). By delaying implementation of certain requirements for \napproximately six months, sponsors would have time to adjust and plan \nfor any changes that may affect their programs. Secondly, delaying the \nimplementation of some regulatory provisions in new au pair regulations \nfor approximately six months would provide sponsors with an opportunity \nto evaluate the impact of the proposed changes on their own exchange \nprograms. This time would allow sponsors to make any necessary \nadjustments or changes to their program models to ensure compliance \nwith the new regulations. Finally, delaying implementation of the new \nau pair regulations for approximately six months would ensure that \ncurrent and future au pairs have a clear understanding of the program \nrequirements and expectations, and that sponsors have time to \ncommunicate these changes effectively to host families and au pairs. \nThis temporary delay would help to minimize confusion and ensure that \nthe au pair program continues to provide high-quality child care and \neducational and cultural exchange experiences for families and au pairs \nalike.\n\nSummary of NPRM\n\n    In summary, the Department of State would modernize the au pair \nprogram and increase au pair protections by proposing the following new \nprovisions:\n    Section 62.31(a). The purpose paragraph introduces a part-time \nprogram (24-31 hours of child care per week) and a full-time program \n(32-40 hours per week).\n    Section 62.31(c). As part of the program conditions, sponsors would \nbe required to establish new standard operating procedures.\n    Section 62.31(d). The au pair eligibility paragraph would require \nsponsors to ensure that au pairs are interviewed by both the sponsor \nand the host family. Au pairs would also be required to have a driver's \nlicense from their home country to demonstrate at\n\n[[Page 74084]]\n\nleast one year of experience driving and be able to obtain a license in \nthe host family jurisdiction, if required.\n    Section 62.31(e). Sponsors would be required to confirm a host \nfamily placement prior to the au pair's departure from the home country \nby obtaining the signatures of the host family and au pair in a Host \nFamily Agreement.\n    Section 62.31(f). The au pair orientation provision would require \nsponsors to provide au pairs with pre-arrival information that covers \ncompensation and benefits (including in-kind benefits); allowable \ndeductions; maximum work hours; time off; child care duties; \ndocumenting child care hours; driving expectations; and, requirements \nfor paying state and Federal taxes.\n    Section 62.31(g). The au pair training paragraph requires sponsors \nto provide au pairs with child safety instruction and child development \ninstruction, an online driving course, and information covering state \nand local driving laws including safety information.\n    Section 62.31(h). The host family eligibility paragraph requires \nsponsors to ensure that host families are prepared to speak English \ndaily and will not reside outside the U.S. for more than 30 days. \nSponsors must also conduct criminal background checks on all host \nfamily household members 18 years of age or older.\n    Section 62.31(i). The host family orientation provision would \nrequire sponsors to provide host families a copy of the Host Family \nAgreement, information on how to document weekly child care hours, and \na print-out of the current page from the Internal Revenue Service's \nwebsite on the topic of ``Taxation of Nonresident Aliens.''\n    Section 62.31(j). This paragraph would formalize the current au \npair and host family agreement and require both the au pair and host \nfamily to sign prior to the au pair departing from their home country, \nas well as identify an itemized list of fees (costs to host family and \nau pair); duties; weekly schedule; compensation; time off for weekends \nand vacation; educational component; room; in-kind benefits (e.g., cell \nphone, gym membership, car for personal use); and, appropriate and \ninappropriate au pair duties.\n    Section 62.31(k). ``Au pair limitations and protections'' is a new \nprovision under which sponsors would require host families to provide a \nhome environment free from sexual harassment, exploitation, or any \nother form of abuse; to not use a nanny cam or take photos without \nprior and ongoing consent; to ensure the au pair is only responsible \nfor the host family children; and, to provide the au pair 80 hours of \npaid time off and 56 hours of sick leave.\n    Section 62.31(l). Rematch would require sponsors to report when an \nau pair is removed from the host family home, determine the au pair \nsuitability to continue the program, and make an expedient, fair and \ngood faith effort to find a new host family placement for suitable au \npairs. Sponsors would be required to refund au pairs if unable to find \na suitable rematch.\n    Section 62.31(m). The ``Hours'' paragraph would require whether the \nau pair will be participating in a part-time or full-time program to be \nstated in the Host Family Agreement, prohibit overtime for child care \nexcept in limited exigent circumstances, and define when an au pair is \nproviding child care.\n    Section 62.31(n). The compensation provision would introduce a new \nfour-tiered compensation chart based on the highest of the Federal, \nState, and local minimum wage. It further explains that au pairs would \nbe compensated for the maximum number of hours in the part-time or \nfull-time program and the extent to which deductions are permissible \nfor room & board and in-kind benefits.\n    Section 62.31(o). The educational component provision would be \namended to eliminate the Educare program and offer new options in \nconjunction with in-person classes (e.g., online class, continuing \neducation classes, and volunteering in their community).\n    Section 62.31(r). The reporting requirements paragraph would add \nnew requirements for sponsors to provide foreign agent information and \nprice lists and an annual itemized program costs/fees list.\n    Section 62.31(t). ``Relationship to state and local laws'' is a new \nprovision that would provide that regulations in this section provide \nthe exclusive requirements in certain matters and may not be \nsupplemented by state or local law except as expressly provided \ntherein.\n\nRegulatory Analysis\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department of State has historically determined that \nrulemakings regarding the Exchange Visitor Program involve a foreign \naffairs function (5 U.S.C. 553(a)) of the United States.\\4\\ However, \ndue to Department of State's interest in seeking public comment on this \nrulemaking, the Department is soliciting comments during a 60-day \ncomment period, to which it will respond in a final rule, should the \nDepartment of State choose to finalize all or part of this proposal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Foreign governments seek to promote the ability of their \nforeign nationals to visit and study in the United States, and the \nDepartment of State establishes modified exchange programs pursuant \nto memoranda of understanding with foreign governments, based on the \nforeign policy needs of the United States. This practice reflects \nthe flexibility needed for a program whose purpose is to promote the \ninterests of the United States abroad and further ``peaceful \nrelations between the United States and the other countries of the \nworld.'' 22 U.S.C. 2451. In connection with that purpose, a major \npurpose of this rulemaking is to protect the health, safety, and \nwelfare of foreign nationals while they are in the United States on \ntheir programs. Failure to protect the health, safety and welfare of \nthese foreign nationals can have direct and substantial adverse \neffects on the foreign affairs of the United States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This regulation will not result in the expenditure by state, local, \nor tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of \n$100 million in any one year. Further, since the regulatory \nrequirements in the proposed rule will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments, no further action by the Department of State \nis required under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nExecutive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department of State has determined that this regulation will \nnot have Tribal implications, will not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian Tribal governments, and will not preempt \nTribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business \nImpacts\n\n    As noted above in the APA section, the Department of State has \nhistorically determined that rulemakings regarding the Exchange Visitor \nProgram involve a foreign affairs function (5 U.S.C. 553(a)) of the \nUnited States. The Department of State voluntarily provides the \nfollowing information regarding the proposed rule's impact on small \nbusinesses.\n    This regulation will affect the operations of fourteen sponsors \ndesignated by the Department of State to conduct exchange programs in \nthe Au pair category. Each organization applied to the Department of \nState to become a designated sponsor of the au pair program, and as \npart of the ongoing administration, sponsors supply their latest \nfinancial year end statements every two years as part of an application \nfor redesignation. Of the fourteen\n\n[[Page 74085]]\n\nsponsors designated in the Au pair category of the Exchange Visitor \nProgram in 2019, all were small sponsors with annual revenues from the \nJ-visa au pair program of approximately $15 million or less. In one \nrecent year, 21,500 foreign nationals started new programs in the Au \npair category. As the au pair program is currently under a new sponsor \nmoratorium and a cap on the number of au pairs annually, we expect a \nsimilar number of au pairs to begin 12-month long exchange programs in \nthe coming years.\n    Many variable costs do not have a significant impact on small \nentities because they are proportionate to the sponsors' program size, \nand thus, revenues. For example, one au pair sponsor only sponsors six \nau pairs annually and the largest sponsor hosts approximately 10,500 au \npairs annually.\n    Sponsors will incur the following range of costs:\n    <bullet> Customize the Host Family Agreement for each au pair \nplacement. The cost to input the host family specific information into \na contract would take one employee one hour at a cost of $72.97 per \nplacement x 21,500 au pair placement = a total aggregate cost of \n$1,568,855. The estimated range of costs for sponsors is $438 for the \nsponsor with the smallest program to $766,185 for the sponsor with the \nlargest program.\n    <bullet> Prepare placement-specific information packages for au \npairs and host families. The Department of State believes that a GS-9 \nlevel staff member could compile, collect, and distribute \nelectronically the required information in one hour per placement, or \n$31.50. For all 21,500 placements, the aggregate cost would be \n$677,250. The estimated range of costs for sponsors is $189 for the \nsponsor with the smallest program to $330,750 for the sponsor with the \nlargest program.\n    <bullet> Vet foreign entity contracts. The Department of State \nestimates that it will require sponsor staff at the GS-9 level two \nhours to vet each foreign entity for a total of $71.62 per foreign \nentity. These costs will vary significantly among sponsors, based upon \ntheir recruiting patterns. The cost to the sponsor with one foreign \nentity will be $71.62. The cost to the sponsor with 51 foreign entities \nwill be $3,652.62. For the entire sponsor community, it will cost \n$27,000.74 to annually vet all 377 foreign entities.\n    <bullet> Updating standard operating procedures to include the new \nrequirements under program conditions--to update the seven standard \noperating procedures by one employee at $72.97 per hour, it would cost \neach sponsor $4,086 to formalize these standard operating procedures. \nThe total cost for all sponsors would be $57,208.\n    <bullet> Updating the existing host family and foreign entity \ncontract templates. It would take one employee at $72.97 per hour a \ntotal of 22 hours for a total of $1,605 per template.\n    <bullet> Updating sponsor orientation materials one-time based on \nnew regulatory requirements. These additional fixed costs would take \none employee at $72.97 per hour a total of 40 hours for a total of \n$2,919.\n    Alternatives Considered. The Department of State considered not \nissuing a proposed rule, but small entities (i.e., sponsors) themselves \nhave asked the Department of State for regulatory clarification about \nhow the Federal regulation interacts with state and local law. The \nconfusion currently created in the au pair program, once eliminated, \nmay reduce costs for sponsors because they can make better business \ndecisions about operations.\n    The au pair regulations have not been updated since 2008, and there \nwere several program administrative areas, such as au pair protections \nand increased educational stipends, that needed to be updated to \nmodernize the au pair program and ensure that the program meets the \npurposes of the Exchange Visitor Program.\n\nExecutive Order 12866\n\n    The Department of State has submitted this proposed rule to the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), and OIRA has \ndetermined that this is an economically significant regulatory action \nper Executive Order 12866.\n    The Department of State asserts that the foreign policy benefits \nfrom preserving this nationwide au pair program, providing for the \nsafety of au pairs, and ensuring accountability of all stakeholders in \nthe au pair program outweigh any additional costs imposed by this \nrulemaking. This section outlines new costs for the program. The costs \nof the new regulations are comprised of fixed and variable costs.\n    For the cost calculations, the Department of State uses the hourly \nwage of mid-range GS-9 Federal workers for support services and the \nhourly wage of mid-range GS-14 Federal workers for those tasks \nrequiring additional experience, such as writing standard operating \nprocedures. The Department of State adds 40% of the GS-9 hourly wage to \nthe base rate to include the cost of benefits (or $22.50 x 140% = \n$31.50). Similarly, the Department of State calculates the GS-14 hourly \nwage as $52.12 + $20.85 = $72.97.\nFixed Costs\n    This regulation will impose total estimated new fixed costs of \n$8,610 for each of the fourteen designated au pair sponsors, or \n$120,540 in the aggregate. The Department of State estimates the size \nof the programs of the fourteen sponsors ranges from six exchange \nvisitors to 10,500 exchange visitors starting new programs each year. \nThe Department of State does not calculate additional costs to host \nfamilies for au pairs who extend their programs as extending au pairs \nremain with their host families and most of the variable costs are \nassociated with evaluating the suitability of the original au pair \nplacement. The fixed costs are those that each sponsor must incur \nregardless of program size. Almost half the fixed costs will be \nincurred formalizing the seven standard operating procedures: (i) \ntraining of headquarters and field staff; (ii) contingency plans for au \npairs removed from a host family; (iii) covering educational costs that \nhost families fail to pay; (iv) allocation of non-income related cost \nof paid time off and sick leave; (v) rematching qualified au pairs to \nnew placements; (vi) establish guidelines and circumstances for au pair \nto be removed from program; and (vii) process for responding and \nreporting to issues, concerns, or emergencies. As discussed below under \n``Program conditions'', to update the seven standard operating \nprocedures by one employee at $72.97 per hour, it would cost each \nsponsor $4,086 to formalize these standard operating procedures. The \ntotal cost for all sponsors would be $57,208.\n    Other fixed costs include updating existing host family and foreign \nentity contracts, as well as updating sponsor orientation materials. \nThese additional fixed costs would take one employee at $72.97 per hour \na total of 22 hours for a total of $1,605 per template and 40 hours to \nupdate orientation templates for a total of $2,919. Total fixed costs \nare $4,086 + $4,524 = $8,610 per sponsor, or $120,540 for all fourteen \nsponsors.\nVariable Costs\n    The Department of State estimates that the variable costs for \nsponsors per au pair placement will increase by $195. This includes the \ncosts of criminal background checks for each adult in the host family \nhome (average two per home) and to customize the Host Family Agreement \nand orientation materials for each placement. In the aggregate, the \nDepartment of State estimates variable costs to be $2,047,500 (10,500 \nau pairs\n\n[[Page 74086]]\n\nx $195) for the largest sponsor. These costs do not have a significant \nimpact on small entities because they are proportionate to the \nsponsors' program size, and thus, revenues. Sponsors will incur costs \nto customize Host Family Agreements to individual placements and to \nprepare placement-specific information packages for au pairs and host \nfamilies. The smallest sponsor with six au pairs will have a variable \ncost of $1,170 (6 au pairs x $195). Another variable cost is associated \nwith the need for sponsors to customize agreements with foreign \nentities and to vet them according to the new requirements. As a \ngeneral matter, smaller sponsors utilize fewer foreign entities because \nthey tend to recruit from fewer foreign countries.\n    Host families would incur variable costs depending on the days \nneeded per week to document hours of child care, with a maximum cost of \n$409.50 per host family annually, or aggregate costs of $8,804,250 (15 \nminutes per week to fill out a timesheet for an estimated cost of (15 \nminutes per week x 52 weeks = 13 hours x $31.50 = $409.50, or an \naggregate of $409.50 x 21,500 host families = $8,804,250).\n    Sponsor and host family new costs and transfers under this \nrulemaking are detailed as follows:\n    Purpose (Sec.  62.31(a)). There are no new costs associated with \nthis provision.\n    Program designation (Sec.  62.31(b)). There are no new costs \nassociated with this provision.\n    Program conditions (Sec.  62.31(c)). This new paragraph on program \nconditions requires sponsors to formalize standard operating procedures \nand internal controls (to confirm the effectiveness of the procedures) \nthat already should be part of their operations. For example, sponsors \nalready assess whether they have sufficient resources to train \nheadquarters and field staff to ensure regulatory compliance and the \nhealth, safety, and welfare of exchange visitors and the children in au \npairs' care. They also already deal with the complications that arise \nwhen irreconcilable differences require au pairs to be removed from \ntheir current host family homes, such as the following: (1) ensuring \nthe safety of au pairs who are awaiting rematches (and no longer live \nwith a host family); (2) allocating among host families the funding of \nthe educational component and non-cash benefits (i.e., paid time off \nand sick leave) when rematches occur; (3) specifying the steps for \nrematching au pairs, including ending programs of otherwise qualified \nau pairs; (4) identifying criteria determining whether au pairs are \nqualified for rematch; and (5) placement-related issues. It is \nestimated that formalizing each standard operating procedure would take \na GS-14, Step 5 equivalent staff person eight hours, for a total of 56 \nhours for all seven procedures. At $72.97 per hour it would cost each \nsponsor $4,086 to formalize these standard operating procedures. The \ntotal cost for all sponsors would be $57,208.\n    The regulations at Sec.  62.31(c)(3) would establish a new \nrequirement that sponsors annually vet and enter into contracts with \nforeign third parties that act on their behalf in the operation of \ntheir exchange programs. Since the regulations already impute to \nsponsors non-compliance by third parties acting on their behalf, it is \nlikely that sponsors already vet foreign entities to ensure their \nsuitability. They also are already required to enter into contracts \nwith them. However, the Department of State is seeking public comment \non these costs.\n    In 2021, the size of the fourteen au pair programs ranged from five \nto nearly 10,500 exchange visitors. The number of foreign entities \nthese sponsors utilized ranged from one to 51. Generally, the number of \nforeign countries from which sponsors recruit exchange visitors \nincreases as the number of total exchange visitors increases. Three of \nthe fourteen sponsors, however, do not follow that pattern, (i.e., they \nrecruit small numbers from multiple countries), resulting in a higher \ncosts per exchange visitor than those sponsors who cluster their \nrecruitment. The cost, however, is minimal.\n    The Department of State anticipates that sponsors will update their \nstandard foreign entity contracts to ensure they conform with current \nregulations. Estimating four hours per contract attorney at $100 per \nhour, it will cost each sponsor $400 to update their current contracts.\n    The Department of State estimates that it will require sponsor \nstaff at the GS-9 level two hours to vet each foreign entity for a \ntotal of $71.62 per foreign entity. These costs will vary significantly \namong sponsors, based upon their recruiting patterns. The cost to the \nsponsor with one foreign entity will be $71.62. The cost to the sponsor \nwith 51 foreign entities will be $3,652.62. For the entire sponsor \ncommunity, it will cost $27,000.74 to annually vet all 377 foreign \nentities.\n    Au pair program eligibility and suitability (Sec.  62.31(d)). \nSponsors already must evaluate the eligibility and suitability of au \npair program candidates. The slight changes in the information they \nmust gather is insignificant as sponsors likely routinely update such \nchecklists.\n    Au pair placement (Sec.  62.31(e)). There are two primary \nclarifying regulatory changes to this paragraph. First, sponsors must \nevaluate the personal space of au pairs in the potential host family \nhomes. The Department of State believes that sponsors already tour a \npotential host family home for a private bedroom when they interview \nthe families, therefore the clarifying requirement of evaluating \npersonal space will result in no additional cost to any party. Second, \nthe current regulations set forth at 22 CFR 62.31(e)(5) already require \nsponsors to provide au pairs with information about the prospective \nhost families and their schedules in a written agreement; and sponsors \nmust provide host families with the au pairs' applications. The \nDepartment of State believes that a GS-9 level staff member could \ncompile, collect, and distribute electronically the required \ninformation in one hour per placement, or $31.50. For all 21,500 \nplacements, the aggregate cost would be $677,250. It would cost the \nsmallest sponsor that brings in five au pairs annually $157.50. It \nwould cost the largest sponsor that brings in 10,500 au pairs $330,750.\n    Au pair orientation (Sec.  62.31(f)). The regulations update the \nrequirements for the existing pre-departure orientation. Sponsors most \nlikely routinely reevaluate their orientation materials, so the cost of \nthese minor changes is insignificant. However, there would be a new \nrequirement for a post-arrival orientation. Sponsors already meet with \nnew au pairs and provide them introductory information based on the \ncurrent regulatory requirements at 22 CFR 62.10(c). Since the proposed \nregulation identifies certain required topics, however, there will be a \ncost associated with incorporating the new provisions into standard \nsponsor materials. The Department of State estimates these new \nrequirements can be completed in eight hours by a staff member at the \nGS-14 level. $72.97 per hour x 8 hours = $583.76 per sponsor or \n$8,172.64 for all fourteen sponsors.\n    Au pair training (Sec.  62.31(g)). The new regulations do not \nmodify the current au pair training requirements except that au pairs \nwho will be required to drive must take on-line or in-person classes to \nbecome familiar with U.S. driving customs and safety. Sponsors also \nmust provide au pairs with jurisdictionally-specific driving \nregulations. Since this information is readily available online, the \nDepartment of State believes this new requirement will not have a \nsubstantial cost. The Department\n\n[[Page 74087]]\n\nestimates online driving courses cost will vary, for example, from $12 \nin California \\5\\ to $45 in New York.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See <a href=\"https://www.driverseddirect.com/california-online-drivers-ed.aspx?ProductID=33&STATE=CA&DC=wow27off&hc=A&source=GOOGLE_DE-NEWBTW_03242022RSAMAXPIN_HCA_DCwow27off&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIifLO5bCg_gIVTBbUAR0VGwS5EAAYAiAAEgJYkvD_BwE\">https://www.driverseddirect.com/california-online-drivers-ed.aspx?ProductID=33&STATE=CA&DC=wow27off&hc=A&source=GOOGLE_DE-NEWBTW_03242022RSAMAXPIN_HCA_DCwow27off&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIifLO5bCg_gIVTBbUAR0VGwS5EAAYAiAAEgJYkvD_BwE</a>.\n    \\6\\ See <a href=\"https://www.idrivesafely.com/new-york/5-hour-pre-licensing-online\">https://www.idrivesafely.com/new-york/5-hour-pre-licensing-online</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Host family selection (Sec.  62.31(h)). Requiring criminal \nbackground checks for adult members living in the host family home is a \nnew requirement. It is likely that there are at most two adults living \nin most homes. County criminal history searches are the most common \nform of criminal background check. The Department estimates a county \ncourt criminal background check will cost $15-$20, and a statewide \ncriminal background check will cost $10-$20. This type of report \ntypically includes address history, age, misdemeanors, felonies, \noffense date, case number, arrest history, and offense description.\\7\\ \nThis is a variable cost that sponsors can pass through to the host \nfamilies. If sponsors chose not to pass through the cost, the cost to \nsponsors is calculated as follows: Assuming an average cost of $20 per \nbackground check, the additional cost would be $40 per placement. With \n21,500 au pairs, the aggregate cost would be $860,000. Since this is a \nvariable cost, it will not have a significant impact on smaller \nsponsors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See <a href=\"https://www.criminalwatchdog.com/faq/how-much-does-background-check-cost\">https://www.criminalwatchdog.com/faq/how-much-does-background-check-cost</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sentrylink.com/web/criminal-check.action?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt_zk5MWL_gIVK__jBx0lYQmgEAAYASAAEgIsNfD_BwE\">https://www.sentrylink.com/web/criminal-check.action?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt_zk5MWL_gIVK__jBx0lYQmgEAAYASAAEgIsNfD_BwE</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Host family orientation (Sec.  62.31(i)). Sponsors will incur a \ncost to prepare materials to reflect new orientation requirements and \nto train field staff on conducting the sessions. The Department of \nState estimates that preparation of these materials could take 16 hours \nby a staff member at the GS-9 level combined with eight hours by a \nstaff member at the GS-14 level: ($31.50/hr x 16 hr) + ($72.97/hr x 8 \nhr) = $1,087.76 per sponsor. The Department of State estimates that \ntraining materials could be developed in eight hours by a staff member \nat the GS-9 level combined with four hours by a staff member at the GS-\n14 level, for a total of $578.36. Together, the development of \norientation and training materials could cost $1,666.12 per sponsor, or \n$23,325.68 for all 14 sponsors.\n    Host Family Agreement (Sec.  62.31(j)). Sponsors must confirm au \npair/host family placements by obtaining the signatures of both host \nfamilies and au pairs on a Host Family Agreement prior to au pairs' \ndeparture from their home countries. This rulemaking requires sponsors \nto update their current agreements by including both new required \ngeneral information and placement-specific information. An average \nhourly fee for a contract attorney is $50, and the Department of State \ndoubles this rate to account for the location of sponsor organization \nin higher cost areas. The Department of State estimates contract \nattorneys could modify existing Host Family Agreements in 16 hours, for \na non-recurring cost per sponsor of $1,600 for drafting initial \nagreements, or $22,400 in the aggregate. Once sponsors engage counsel \nto update their Host Family Agreements to include the new required \ninformation, they will need to customize the agreements for each new \nplacement. The Department of State estimates sponsors will spend two \nhours. It is estimated that customizing the agreements and obtaining \nrequired signatures would take a GS-9 Step 5 equivalent staff person \ntwo hours, for a total of $63.00 per placement. The aggregate cost for \nthe 14 sponsors and estimating 21,500 new au pairs each year is \nestimated to be $1,354,500 per year. Of course, each sponsor's portion \nof this total is driven by their program sizes, with the least impact \nfalling on small sponsors.\n    Au pair limitations and protections (Sec.  62.31(k)). It is unknown \nwhether host families will incur additional costs by having to obtain \nalternative child care when au pairs are using paid time off or sick \nleave. They may incur additional costs if their child care needs exceed \nprogram maximum hours each week. The costs incurred for exigent \ncircumstances that require overtime are discussed below under \n``Hours''. Costs to host families for one-off days are unknown as host \nfamilies may have family members or alternative caregivers who can \nprovide child care if the au pair is on sick leave. The Department of \nState seeks comment on these potential costs.\n    Rematch (Sec.  62.31(l)). The Department of State has implemented a \nnew refund requirement for sponsors who are unable to rematch au pairs \nwho are eligible to continue on program if their first host family \nmatches are not successful. This new requirement is designed both to \nprovide a greater incentive for sponsors to make good initial matches \nand to provide an additional protection for au pairs who, through no \nfault of their own, are unable to continue on the program. Sponsors \nthat are unable to find alternative host families for au pairs that are \ndeemed qualified for rematching (i.e., the rematch was required through \nno fault of the au pairs) may face significant costs. The new \nregulation requires sponsors to refund au pairs who are qualified for \nrematch, but for whom their sponsors are unable to find new suitable \nhost families. Refunds range from 25 percent to 75 percent of all fees \nau pairs paid to both sponsors and foreign third parties, depending \nupon the proportion of the duration of the program the au pairs were \nable to complete. Because qualified au pairs who are awaiting a rematch \nwill continue to need room and board even though they are not being \npaid for child care, the new regulations also require sponsors to \nensure that au pairs have lodging and food during this transition \nperiod.\n    The Department is seeking public comment on what specific costs \nsponsors are likely to incur in the event of a rematch.\n    Hours (Sec.  62.31(m)). Sponsors must collect documentation from \nhost families that records the weekly hours and leave of au pairs. The \nDepartment of State estimates it will take each sponsor two hours to \ndesign the form for collection of this data. Each sponsor will incur \nthe fixed cost of $63, with the aggregate cost for all sponsors being \n$882. The Department of State estimates no additional time to collect \nsuch documentation, as the collection can be part of the monthly \nmonitoring process.\n    Host families would be required to document the weekly hours of the \nau pair. The Department of State estimates it will take each host \nfamily no more than 15 minutes per week to fill out a timesheet for an \nestimated cost of: 15 minutes x 52 weeks = 13 hours x $31.50 = $409.50, \nor an aggregate of $409.50 x 21,500 host families = $8,804,250.\n    Au pairs would not be permitted to provide more than 40 hours of \nchild care per week, except when requested, approved, and documented \nthrough the sponsor. If host families need infrequent exceptions and \nask the au pair to work overtime, host families would be required to \npay overtime rates to the au pair and notify the sponsor in writing. \nThe overtime rate must include any overtime premium due under \napplicable Federal, state, or local law for the host family \njurisdiction. This cost varies per jurisdiction.\n    Compensation (Sec.  62.31(n)). The proposed regulations will \nrequire some host families to pay a significantly higher wage than the \nFederal minimum wage that is currently required. Some host families \nalready do pay higher compensation based on the skill level of the au \npair or to cover higher living\n\n[[Page 74088]]\n\nexpenses. Host families under the current regulations pay an estimated \n$10,140 ($195 a week x 52 weeks) to $15,000 annually in compensation \nper au pair per year across the United States. This does not include \nprogram fees and other in-kind benefits which are additional expenses \nto host families.\n    The proposed annual host family compensation increase in transfers \nare determined based on the four-tiered wage formula. After subtracting \nthe maximum for meal and lodging credits of $6,790, (assuming that the \ndeduction is permissible each day and week of the year), host families \nwould pay an annual estimate based on the following tiered levels per \nau pair: Tier 1--$9,850.00 (40 hours/week x 52 weeks = 2,080 hours at \n$8/hour = $16,640-$67,906,790 meals/lodging = $9,850), Tier 2--\n$18,170.00, Tier 3--$24,410.00, and Tier 4--$30,650.00. Any overtime \nexpenses for exigent circumstances are discussed below under hours.\n    Currently only two states, California and Washington, and the \ncities of Washington, District of Columbia, and Denver, Colorado, would \nfall under Tier 4. There are currently 2,947 au pairs in California, \n1,141 au pairs in Washington, 378 in the District of Columbia, and 260 \nin Denver, Colorado identified as Tier 4, or a total of 4,726 au pairs \nout of the annual estimated 21,500 au pairs--or an estimated 22% \n(4,726/21,500) of au pairs living in Tier 4. Therefore, the total \ncompensation increase for Tier 4 is: ($30,650 (the proposed wage) -\n$10,140 (the current wage) = $20,510 x 4,726 (22% of 21,500) = \n$96,930,260 million increase for Tier 4 au pairs.\n    For a sampling of Tier 3, we are using an estimate of 25 percent of \nau pairs that fall within this tier. The transfer payment would be for \n5,375 au pairs out of 21,500 and an increase of $24,410-$10,140 (the \ncurrent wage) = $14,270 x 5,375 = $76,701,250.\n    For a sampling of Tier 2, we are using an estimate of 25 percent of \nau pairs that fall within this tier. The transfer payment would be for \n5,375 au pairs out of 21,500 and an increase of $18,170-$10,140 (the \ncurrent wage) = $8,030 x 5,375 = $43,161,250.\n    There are a number of states in which the Federal minimum wage is \nstill equal to the highest applicable wage and any increase would be \nminimal as a result of this rulemaking. As an estimate, 28 percent of \nau pairs identified may fall in Tier 1, or a total of 6,024 au pairs \nout of 21,500) of au pairs living in Tier 1 would lead to a transfer \ndecrease from host families of $9,850-10,140 (current wage for 45 hours \nper week) = -$-290 x 28% of 21,500 = $-1,746,960.\n    Therefore, the total increase in transfers from host families to au \npairs is estimated to be $215,045,800 (sum of the four tiers' \ntransfers).\n    Educational component (Sec.  62.31(o)). The educational stipend of \n$500 for an au pair to take college level classes has not been updated \nsince 1993. Sponsors have always been responsible for tracking whether \nhost families pay the educational stipend and that au pairs complete \nthe required coursework and/or community service. There is no \nadditional cost for sponsors as a result of the rule change. However, \nsponsors will require host families, to pay a higher educational \nstipend of $1,200, an increase of $700 than currently required. The \nincreased cost to 21,500 host families x $700 increase would be \n$15,050,000.\n    Monitoring (Sec.  62.31(p)). Sponsors already must monitor their au \npair placements. There is no significant change to the monitoring \nprovisions that would result in any significant cost increase for \nsponsors.\n    Duration and extensions (Sec.  62.31(q)). The new regulation does \nnot impose any new requirements.\n    Reporting requirements (Sec.  62.31(r)). There are two changes to \nthe current reporting requirements. First, sponsors must submit \nannually the following current schedules: a listing of all fees they \nmay charge au pair applicants/participants to participate in the \nprogram and listings on a country-specific basis of all fees foreign \nthird parties acting on their behalf may charge au pair applicants/\nparticipants to participate in the program. In support of these \nlistings, sponsors must provide website links to both the sponsors' and \nall their foreign entities' websites on which such fees are posted. \nAdditionally, sponsors must inform the Department of State of any \nchanges in the identity of or information about the foreign entities \nthey engage to assist in their programs. The Department of State \npresumes that both sponsors and foreign entities already maintain such \nfee schedules and that there is little churn in the identity of the \nthird parties with which sponsors work. Accordingly, the Department of \nState estimates that the cost of complying with these new requirements \nis de minimis.\n    Repeat participation (Sec.  62.31(s)). The new regulation does not \nimpose any new requirements. The Department of State asserts that the \nforeign policy benefits from preserving a nationwide au pair program, \nproviding for the safety of au pairs, and ensuring accountability of \nall stakeholders in the au pair program outweigh any additional costs \nimposed by this rulemaking.\n\nSummary of Benefits, Costs and Transfers\n\n    To summarize, the annual increase in transfers from host families \nto au pairs is estimated to be $230,095,800 (sum of the four tiers' \ntransfers plus increased educational expenses). One-time costs are \nestimated to be $142,940, and recurring annual costs are estimated to \nbe $15,923,673, of which $8.9 million are paperwork burden costs \nincurred by the program's 21,500 host families. The primary benefits of \nthis rulemaking are reduced confusion about the relationship between \nthe Federal au pair regulations and state and local law, which will \nhelp to increase participation; a number of safeguards for au pairs and \nhost families that may also increase participation and ultimately \nbenefit sponsors; and, preserving a nationwide program that advances \nthe foreign policy objectives of the Exchange Visitor Program.\n    The Department of State notes that the increased costs and \ntransfers, especially associated with compensation and educational \nexpenses, could result in a decline in host families in the au pair \nprogram. Host families in regions with higher minimum wage rates may \nseek alternative child care options if the compensation costs outweigh \nthe benefit of a cultural exchange program for their family. This may \nalso result in a reduction of au pairs annually coming to the United \nStates on a J visa. The Department of State requests comment on the \nextent to which these increased costs and transfers may deter host \nfamilies from participating in the au pair program.\n    The Department of State has chosen to analyze the impact of this \nproposed rule over a five-year time horizon. While this proposed \nregulation stipulates that the Department of State will update the \nhourly pay rates in the four-tiered au pair compensation chart in \nresponse to changing economic conditions not less than every three \nyears, the Department is unable to forecast economic conditions at this \ntime, and therefore assumes that the compensation tiers will remain the \nsame for at least the next five years. The Department of State is \nrequesting comment on this assumption. The below table outlines the \ntotal discounted (at 3% and 7%) and annualized costs and transfers over \nthe analytic period:\n\n[[Page 74089]]\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Year 1                   Year 2                    Year 3             Year 4             Year 5\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnnual Costs................................        $16,066,613  $15,923,673...................        $15,923,673        $15,923,673        $15,923,673\nAnnual Transfers............................        230,095,800  230,095,800...................        230,095,800        230,095,800        230,095,800\nTotal Costs (3%)............................         73,064,536  Annualized (3%)...............         15,953,975  .................  .................\nTotal Transfers (3%)........................      1,053,771,389  Annualized (3%)...............        230,095,800  .................  .................\nTotal Costs (7%)............................         65,423,792  Annualized (7%)...............         15,956,254  .................  .................\nTotal Transfers (7%)........................        943,438,209  Annualized (7%)...............        230,095,800  .................  .................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExecutive Order 12988\n\n    The Department of State has reviewed this rulemaking in light of \nsections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate \nambiguity, minimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and \nreduce burdens.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132--Federalism\n\n    A rule has federalism implications under Executive Order 13132 if, \ninter alia, it has ``substantial direct effects on the distribution of \npower and responsibilities among municipalities, states, and the \nfederal government.'' 64 FR 43244. While this proposed rule \nmemorializes the Department of State's view of the distribution of \npower and responsibilities in this area, the Department of State \nrecognizes that section 4 of Executive Order 13132 specifically \nprovides for notice and an opportunity to participate for affected \nState and local officials. Accordingly, even though the Department of \nState does not believe that it is required to consult with states or \nlocal governments under Executive Order 13132 because the proposed rule \ndoes not alter the basic State-Federal scheme established under the \nstatutes that created the Exchange Visitor Program, the Department of \nState welcomes comments on this proposed rulemaking from state and \nlocal governments, in order to improve the administration of the au \npair program and to maximize stakeholder input. Executive Order 12372 \nregarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and \nactivities does not apply to this regulation.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    The Department of State submitted to the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB), for review and approval, the reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements inherent in this rulemaking. This proposed rule requires \nnew collection of information by sponsors.\n    The information collection requirements contained in this proposed \nrule are described pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act and OMB \nControl Number 1405-0147, Form DS-7000, which requires collection of \nadditional information for the Exchange Visitor Program. As part of \nthis rulemaking, the Department of State is seeking comment on the \nadministrative burden associated with modifying the collection of \ninformation.\n    This is an expansion of an information collection utilized by the \nBureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in its administration and \nprogram oversight of the Exchange Visitor Program (J-Visa) under the \nprovisions of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act, as \namended.\n    (1) Type of Information Collection: Revision.\n    (2) Title of the Form/Collection: Recording, Reporting, and Data \nCollection Requirements under 22 CFR part 62.\n    (3) Agency form number: DS-7000.\n    (4) Affected public: This information collection will require \nrecordkeeping, disclosures to host families, and reporting by \ndesignated sponsors.\n    (5) Change to information collected by the Department of State: The \nDepartment of State is proposing changes to recordkeeping and reporting \nrequirements for sponsors:\n    <bullet> Sponsors will update each host family agreement to include \nrequired disclosures between the exchange visitor and host family \n(proposed 62.31(j)).\n    <bullet> Sponsors will require host families to document actual \nhours worked by the au pair and provide those records to the sponsor \n(proposed 62.31(m)). Host families would be required to document the \nweekly hours of the au pair in a timesheet.\n    <bullet> Sponsors will report new information to the Department of \nState annually, including: a listing of all fees they may charge au \npair applicants/participants to participate in the program and listings \non a country-specific basis of all fees foreign third parties acting on \ntheir behalf may charge au pair applicants/participants to participate \nin the program. In support of these listings, sponsors must provide \nwebsite links to both the sponsors' and all their foreign entities' \nwebsites on which such fees are posted (proposed 62.31(r)).\n    <bullet> Sponsors will maintain records of business license, \nbankruptcy, previous experience, and notarized recent financial \nstatements for overseas third parties (proposed 62.31(c)(3)(ii)).\n    <bullet> Sponsors must conduct and document a host family \norientation session for all adult family members. Sponsors must provide \nto the host family copies of the signed and dated Host Family \nAgreement, the Department of State's Exchange Visitor Program \nregulations, brochures, and advisory letters regarding the au pair \nprogram, and a print-out of the current page from the Internal Revenue \nService's website on the topic of ``Taxation of Nonresident Aliens'' \n(proposed 62.31(i)).\n    (6) An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount \nof time estimated for an average respondent to respond: The total \nnumber of respondents for the au pair are the fourteen organizations \ndesignated by the Department of State at the time of this rulemaking to \nconduct the au pair exchange program activities. The estimated hour \nburden per response for preparing the host family agreement (62.31(j)) \nis 2 hours. The estimated hour burden per response for documenting the \nau pair child care hours (62.31(m)) is 2 hours. The Department of State \nestimates it will take each host family no more than 15 minutes per \nweek or 13 hours per respondent to fill out a timesheet. The estimated \nhour burden per response for annual reporting to the Department of \nState (62.31(r)) is de minimus. The estimated hour burden per sponsor \nfor maintaining records on the foreign third party (62.31(c)(3)) is 54 \nhours. The estimated hour burden per sponsor per response for the host \nfamily orientation disclosures (62.31(i)) is 24 hours. In sum, the \nannual burden is estimated to be an additional 82 hours per respondent \n(sponsor). The Department of State invites public comment on these \nestimates.\n    (7) An estimate of the total annual public burden (in hours) \nassociated with the collection: The total estimated annual hour burden \nassociated with this collection is 280,648 hours (82 hours per sponsor \nx 14 sponsors + 13 hours per host family x 21,500 host families).\n    (8) An estimate of the total public burden (in cost) associated \nwith the collection: The estimated total annual\n\n[[Page 74090]]\n\ncost burden associated with this collection of information is \n$8,845,057.\n    The Department of State seeks public comment on:\n    <bullet> Whether the collection of information is necessary for the \nproper performance of the functions of the Department of State, \nincluding whether the information will have practical utility;\n    <bullet> The accuracy of the Department of State's estimate of the \nburden of the collection of information, including the validity of the \nmethodology and assumptions used;\n    <bullet> The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be \ncollected; and\n    <bullet> How to minimize the burden of the collection of \ninformation on those who are to respond, including through the use of \nappropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological \ncollection techniques or other forms of information technology, (e.g., \npermitting electronic submission of responses).\n\nList of Subjects for Part 62\n\n    Cultural exchange programs, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\n    Accordingly, the Department of State proposes to amend 22 CFR part \n62 as follows:\n\nPART 62--EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAM\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 62 is revised to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J), 1182, 1184, 1258; 22 U.S.C. \n1431 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 2651(a); Pub.

The following amount is a permissible credit under the FLSA \ntowards an au pair's wages for lodging actually provided: $54.38 per \nweek. The total permissible credit towards an au pair's wages per week \nfor a full seven days of room and board actually provided is $130.54 (7 \ntimes $10.88 equals $76.16 for a full week of meals plus $54.38 for a \nfull week of lodging). The permissible credit does not change based on \nthe tier wage level at which the au pair is compensated.\n    (3) Host families are permitted to deduct from au pair's pay any \ncost of in-kind benefits that are agreed upon in the Host Family \nAgreement. The host family may charge the au pair for such benefits if \nthe au pair agrees to the charge and the host family does not profit \nfrom the amount charged. The host family may not, however, deduct from \nthe au pair's wages items that are primarily for the benefit or \nconvenience of the host family or sponsor, nor may the host family \nrequire the au pair to reimburse the host family in cash for the cost \nof such items in lieu of deducting the cost from the au pair's wages. \nThe host family may charge the au pair for such benefits only if the \nin-kind benefit is truly for the benefit of the au pair, the au pair \nagrees to the charge, and the host family does not profit from the \namount charged. Sponsors must ensure that the host family does not \ncharge the au pair if the host family requires the au pair to accept \nany of the benefits (such as a cell phone so that the family may reach \nthe au pair); and\n    (4) The hourly rate of compensation is based on a multi-tiered \nsystem.\n    (i) The sponsor must first identify the highest of the Federal, \nState, or local minimum wage rate that applies to the jurisdiction in \nwhich the host family's primary residence is located;\n    (ii) The sponsor then determines the hourly rate the host family \nmust pay the au pair based on the tier in which the rate identified \nfalls in the following table:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Based upon the host family city,\n                                           the highest of Federal, State,             Au pair receives\n                                                  or local min wage\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTier 1..................................  $7.25-$8.00 per hour............  $8 per hour.\nTier 2..................................  $8.01-$12.00 per hour...........  $12 per hour.\nTier 3..................................  $12.01-$15.00 per hour..........  $15 per hour.\nTier 4..................................  $15.01-$18.00 per hour..........  $18 per hour.*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Or the applicable Federal, State, or local minimum hourly wage, if higher.\n\n    (iii) The au pair receives the maximum amount of the identified \ntier, or the highest of the applicable Federal, State, or local minimum \nwage if higher.\n    (iv) When part-time au pairs work more than 31 hours in a week \nregardless of the reason but not more than 40 hours, they shall be \ncompensated for those excess hours at the hourly rate of the applicable \ntier identified in paragraph (n)(4)(ii) of this section or the highest \nof the applicable Federal, State, or local minimum wage if higher. When \npart-time or full-time au pairs work over 40 hours in a week regardless \nof the reason, they shall be compensated for those excess hours at the \nhourly rate of the applicable tier identified in paragraph (n)(4)(ii) \nof this section or the highest of the applicable Federal, State, or \nlocal minimum wage if higher, and they must also be paid any overtime \npremium due under applicable Federal, State, or local law. In addition, \nau pairs must be paid any other overtime premiums due under applicable \nFederal, State, or local law for other hours worked.\n    (v) The Department of State will periodically, but no less than \nevery three years (or at any shorter interval that is desirable and \nfeasible), update the hourly pay rates in the chart in paragraph \n(n)(4)(ii) of this section via Notice, in the Federal Register, in \nresponse to changes in economic conditions. The required change will be \naccomplished by adjusting the upper range of each tier by an identical \namount each update cycle. Although the Department of State will strive \nto increase the hourly pay rates in the chart to keep up with the \nhighest applicable minimum wage, if an au pair resides in a \njurisdiction that has a minimum wage that is higher than the upper \nrange of Tier 4, the au pair shall be paid at that higher minimum wage \nrate regardless of the rate in Tier 4.\n    (o) Educational component. A sponsor must ensure that au pairs \ncomplete one of the following four educational component options during \nan initial, extended, or rematched program:\n    (1) Academic coursework option: Enroll in or register at a U.S. \npost-secondary accredited academic institution and demonstrate that the \nau pair either completed with a passing mark or successfully audited \nthe required course(s).\n    (i) For the initial twelve-month program and for a nine- or twelve-\nmonth extension, an au pair must pass or formally audit academic \ncoursework equivalent to three semester classes (nine semester hours or \ntheir equivalent).\n    (A) An au pair may pursue no more than one third of the required \ncoursework online if local circumstances permit.\n    (B) This coursework must be spread over two semesters or \nequivalent.\n    (ii) For a six-month extension, an au pair must attend in-person \nclasses and pass or formally audit academic coursework equivalent to \none semester class (three semester hours or their equivalent)\n    (2) Continuing education option: Enroll in a continuing education \ninstitution and successfully complete in-person classroom-based \ncoursework.\n\n[[Page 74096]]\n\n    (i) For the initial twelve-month program and for a nine- or twelve-\nmonth extension, an au pair must successfully complete 10 continuing \neducation credits/units (CEUs) which is equivalent to 100 contact \nhours;\n    (ii) For a six-month extension an au pair must successfully \ncomplete five CEUs or 50 contact hours.\n    (3) Customized course option: Enroll in an in-person classroom-\nbased, customized course designed for au pairs and developed by a \nsponsor with a U.S. post-secondary accredited academic institution or a \ncontinuing education institution:\n    (i) For the initial twelve-month program and for a nine-or twelve-\nmonth extension, an au pair must pass or formally audit a customized \ncourse that is equivalent to nine semester hours, ten CEUs, or 100 \ncontact hours.\n    (ii) For a six-month extension, an au pair must successfully \ncomplete three semester hours, five CEUs, or 50 contact hours,\n    (4) Combination option: Complete a combination of community service \nand in-person academic or continuing education coursework.\n    (i) For the initial twelve-month program and for a nine- or twelve-\nmonth extension, an au pair must successfully complete:\n    (A) 48 hours of volunteer, unpaid community service at a 501(c)(3) \ntax exempt organization that is dedicated to a charitable, civic, \nhumanitarian, or other similar purpose; and\n    (B) Successfully pass or audit three semester hours of in-person \nclassroom based academic coursework at a U.S. post-secondary academic \ninstitution, or five CEUs or 50 contact hours of in-person continuing \neducation classes.\n    (ii) For a six-month extension, an au pair must successfully \ncomplete:\n    (A) 45 hours of volunteer, unpaid community service at a 501(c)(3) \ntax exempt organization that is dedicated to a charitable, civic, \nhumanitarian, or other similar purpose; or\n    (B) Successfully pass or audit three semester hours of in-person \nclassroom based academic coursework at a U.S. post-secondary academic \ninstitution or five CEUs or 50 contact hours of in-person continuing \neducation classes.\n    (5) Incomplete Educational Component.

    "supplementary_information": "This rule finalizes the Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking that was published on March 3, 2020. 85 FR 13104. It \nimplements the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Improvement Act of \n2016, Public Law 114-185, and updates the Department's FOIA regulations \nat 22 CFR part 171. The following summary of the substantive changes to \nPart 171 was included in the NPRM but is provided here for convenience.\n    The rule, in Sec.  171.4, provides updated procedures and addresses \nfor submitting FOIA requests to the Department, including procedures \nfor requesting information about the requester and requests for visa \ninformation.\n    Subpart B of the rule (Sec. Sec.  171.10 through 171.17) contains \nthe rules governing the processing of a FOIA request. Section 171.11 \ncovers the Department's initial processing of a request; it clarifies \nthe information that is to be provided as part of a request, the \nDepartment's process for responding to requests, and consultation and \nreferral with respect to requests. Section 171.12 covers the timing of \nresponses to a request, including multi-track processing, expedited \nprocessing, and ``unusual circumstances'' (as defined in the FOIA) that \nmight affect the Department's ability to respond. Section 171.13 covers \nresponses to requests, including the procedures upon denial of a \nrequest. The updates add a provision for consultation with the \nDepartment of Justice's Office of Information Policy with respect to \ninvocation of a FOIA exclusion. Section 171.14 modifies the \nDepartment's process with respect to reviews of confidential commercial \ninformation, including procedures for the owner of the information to \nobject to the release of the information.\n    Section 171.15 revises the timeline for submission of appeals to 90 \ndays and provides for information to be given to requesters about \ndispute resolution services at various stages of the processing of a \nrequest, in accordance with the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. Section \n171.16 provides updates on the fees to be charged for FOIA requests, \nincluding how fees are calculated. This section provides an updated \nexplanation of the term, ``representative of the news media.''\n    Subpart C contains the rule's Privacy Act provisions. There are two \nsubstantive changes in this subpart from that published in the NPRM. \nThe first relates to a Privacy Act exemption that was published after \nthe NPRM was published. See the final rule on March 9, 2020, ``Privacy \nAct; STATE-01, Email Archive Management Records,'' 85 FR 13482. This \nSORN was added to the lists in paragraph (a)(2)(iii), and (b)(1), (2), \n(3), (4), (5), (6) and (7). However, the Department has now determined \nthat this item was added in error, and the Department is removing \nSTATE-01 from the lists of Privacy Act exemptions in Sec. Sec.  \n171.26(a)(2)(iii), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(6), and (b)(7). \nThe reason for this action is that the Department has determined that \nits email records do not constitute a system of records under the \nPrivacy Act; therefore, STATE-01, ``Email Archive Management Records'', \nwill be\n\n[[Page 71738]]\n\nrescinded. The Department finds that there is good cause for making \nthis amendment subsequent to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Since \nSTATE-01 will be rescinded as not describing a system of records under \nthe Privacy Act, it must be removed from the lists in Sec.  171.26.\n    Also in Subpart C, there is a change relating to the ``Risk \nAnalysis and Management'' System of Records Notice (SORN) (STATE-78), \nwhich was established in 2011.\\1\\ At the time, it appeared that the \nDepartment anticipated sending and receiving classified national \nsecurity name checks on some individuals. For that reason, this \nDepartment provided notice that this SORN would be exempt from certain \nportions of the Privacy Act, including Sec.  552a(k)(1), which exempts \nrecords from certain provisions of the Privacy Act if the records are \nclassified records subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1). As \nit turned out, no classified records have been, or will be, included in \nSTATE-78. Therefore, the exemption is not required, and the Department \nis removing it from the list in Sec.  171.26(b)(1). Although this is a \nnew action taken since the proposed rule was published, the Department \nbelieves that public comment thereon is not required since the \nDepartment is removing, not imposing, a Privacy Act exemption, and it \nis in the public interest for such action to be concluded \nexpeditiously.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 76 FR 76103, finalized at 80 FR 1847.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In Subpart D, the rule adds information about processing of \nrequests for confidential financial disclosure reports.\n    Finally, the final rule makes minor changes throughout, to conform \nmore closely to the Department of Justice Office of Information Policy \n(OIP) Template for Agency FOIA Regulations, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/oip/template-agency-foia-regulations\">https://www.justice.gov/oip/template-agency-foia-regulations</a> (the ``OIP Template'') \\2\\ and to \nimplement operational lessons learned since the last major revision of \nthe Department's FOIA regulations on April 6, 2016. See ``Public Access \nto Information'', 81 FR 19863. The names of two Department bureaus have \nchanged since publication of the NPRM: the Bureau of Human Resources is \nnow the Bureau of Global Talent Management; and the Office of Medical \nServices is now the Bureau of Medical Services.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ See also ``Guidance for Agency FOIA Regulations'' at <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/oip/oip-guidance/guidance-agency-foia-regulations\">https://www.justice.gov/oip/oip-guidance/guidance-agency-foia-regulations</a> \n(last accessed March 30, 2021)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResponse to Public Comments\n\n    The Department would like to thank the members of the public for \nreviewing the proposed changes to the FOIA and Privacy Act regulations, \nand for providing very useful feedback. The Department received 10 \nsubstantive comments, which were contained in two documents, from the \nInternational Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) and the Immigration \nReform Law Institute (IRLI). The Department also received four \nsubmissions that were nonresponsive, in that they had nothing to do \nwith the proposed rule.\n    First public comment:\n    IRAP stated that it is concerned about the lack of explanation or \njustification by the Department for the proposed changes to its FOIA \nregulations.\n    Department response:\n    As noted in the proposed rule, there have been changes in the law \ngoverning disclosure of information, including the Freedom of \nInformation Act Improvement Act of 2016. The Department is revising its \nFOIA regulations to make them consistent with the FOIA Improvement Act \nof 2016 and current law, policy, and the Department of Justice, Office \nof Information Policy, template for agency FOIA regulations.\n    Second public comment:\n    IRAP suggests that the proposed rule in Sec.  171.4(a)(7), Proof of \nThird-Party Consent, contains too broad a discretion to effectively \ndeny requests, without any substantive standard or procedural \nsafeguards to ensure that the Department's denial is appropriate. IRAP \nfurther contends that the Department did not take into account the \ndifficulties this could impose on some requesters considering the \nburden the requirements for obtaining such records can be in the \nimmigration context. These requesters are often overseas in difficult \ncircumstances as they await the results of their application for \nresettlement in the United States and may face the possible struggle to \nfind safe and affordable access to a printer and scanner, notary, and \npostal service.\n    Department response:\n    With respect to requests for third-party records, Sec.  171.4(a)(7) \nprovides that ``a requester may receive greater access by submitting a \nnotarized authorization signed by the person whose records are \nrequested, or by submitting a declaration made in compliance with the \nrequirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by the person whose records \nare requested, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, \nor by submitting proof that the third party is deceased (e.g., a copy \nof a death certificate or an obituary).'' The rule does not require the \nrequester to produce all these items. In fact, the rule does not say \nthat the requester must produce any of the items, but that there might \nbe a more expeditious response if more information is presented. The \nprovisions of this rule are intended to advise the requester of the \ntype of documentation to submit to ensure the most expeditious release \nof responsive records, while still protecting the privacy of the \nindividual to whom the records pertain. It is not intended to deny the \ndisclosure of records.\n    The Department agrees to remove the text, ``As an exercise of \nadministrative discretion, the Department may require a requester to \nsupply additional information in order to verify that a particular \nindividual has consented to disclosure or is deceased.''\n    Pertaining to requests for visa records (Sec.  171.4(a)(8)), the \nrequirements have been simplified. The Department has eliminated the \nrequirement for the submission of the country and Foreign Service post \nwhere the visa application was made; when the visa application was \nmade; and whether the visa application was granted or denied (and if \ndenied, on what grounds).\n    The Department's public FOIA website provides requesters with \nfurther information regarding the electronic submission of their \nrequest and supplemental documentation, thereby eliminating the need \nfor a requester to have access to a printer, scanner, notary, or postal \nservice. The Department does not see a need to make any revisions to \nthis section.\n    Third public comment:\n    IRAP notes that the proposed rule text in proposed Sec.  \n171.4(a)(8), Documents in Visa Files Not Within 212(f), omits language \nin the current regulations on visa-related requests. Specifically, it \nomits what types of records may be released. IRAP suggests that the \nchange expands the scope of the exemption and has the potential to harm \napplicants by preventing them from obtaining important notices about \nbenefits and leaving them without a means to obtain those documents.\n    Department response:\n    The Department will add the following text to the end of Sec.  \n171.4(a)(8): ``Other information found in the visa file, such as \ninformation submitted as part of the visa application and information \nnot falling within section 222(f) or another FOIA exemption, may be \nprovided to the requester.''\n    Fourth public comment:\n    IRAP suggests that the proposed rule in Sec.  171.4(b), Description \nof Records\n\n[[Page 71739]]\n\nSought, adds text that would give the Department broad discretion to \ndeny or delay requests that are not able to meet this high standard of \nspecificity. Also, IRAP contends that a requester may be able to \nprovide some specifics regarding the topic matter but will not be able \nto provide such details as the author, file designation, or reference \nnumber of records that have never before been made publicly available.\n    Department response:\n    A request must reasonably describe the Department record(s) that \nthe requester seeks. Requesters must describe the records sought in \nsufficient detail to enable agency personnel to locate them with a \nreasonable amount of effort. If a requester submits a request that \nmeets the criteria, the request will be processed. If after receiving a \nrequest the Department determines that the request does not reasonably \ndescribe the records sought, the Department will inform the requester \nthat the request is insufficient and may ask for additional \ninformation. FOIA calls for as much specificity as requesters can \nprovide; if the Department cannot identify the record, it cannot act on \nthe request, and it is up to requesters to identify what records they \nare seeking (see FOIA subsections (a)(1)-(3) and (b)). In addition, the \nproposed section is drawn directly from the DOJ Template, Section III. \nThe final rule is consistent with current law, policy, and the OIP \nTemplate.\n    Fifth public comment:\n    IRAP is concerned that the proposed regulation on expedited \nprocessing (proposed Sec.  171.12(d), Grounds for Expedited \nProcessing), removes the text ``compelling need'' as a factor in \nexpedited processing.\n    Department response:\n    The Department agrees to revise the text to state that ``requests \nshall receive expedited processing when a requester demonstrates that a \n`compelling need' for the information exists. A `compelling need' is \ndeemed to exist where the requester can demonstrate one of the \nfollowing:''\n    Sixth public comment:\n    IRAP stated that the proposed text in Sec.  171.12(d)(4), Timeline \nto Appeal Denial of Expedited Processing, removes language in the \ncurrent regulations about a timeline for appealing a denial of \nexpedited processing and provides only that ``[i]f a request for \nexpedited processing is denied, the Department must act on any appeal \nof that decision expeditiously.''\n    Department response:\n    The Department agrees to revise the text to state that ``A denial \nof a request for expedited processing may be appealed within 90 \ncalendar days of the date of the Department's letter denying the \nrequest. A decision in writing on the appeal will be issued within 10 \ncalendar days of the receipt of the appeal.''\n    Seventh public comment:\n    Regarding proposed Sec.  171.14(c)(1-2), When Notice to Submitters \nIs Not Required, IRAP states that the ``Department does not provide a \nreason why it would not provide individual notifications to ensure that \nall submitters were informed, rather than `likely' to be informed, of \nthe `descri[ption] of the business information requested' or `copy of \nthe requested records or record portions containing the information' in \nthe notice.''\n    Department response:\n    The Department proposed the change to the rule as a way of \nfacilitating handling notifications when there are voluminous \nresponses. However, after review, the Department will delete the \nadditional text.\n    Eighth public comment:\n    In proposed Sec.  171.15(a)(1), Incorrect Citation, IRAP states \nthat the proposed text for Sec.  171.15(a)(1) cites to examples of \nadverse determination in Sec.  171.13(d) of the proposed text. The text \nshould cite to the proposed Sec.  171.13(e).\n    Department response:\n    The Department agrees to revise the incorrect citation at Sec.  \n171.15(a)(1) from Sec.  171.13(d) to Sec.  171.13(e).\n    Ninth public comment:\n    IRAP states that, in Sec.  171.16, Costs of Search and Review Time, \nthe proposed text for Sec.  171.16(b)(5) and Sec.  171.16(b)(6) removes \nprovisions in the current regulations for costs of search and review \ntime and a quota of pages provided free of charge. The commenter is \nconcerned that this will impact certain categories of requesters when \nthey do not meet the criteria for those who are not charged fees.\n    Department response:\n    The Department will add the following text as the penultimate \nsentence of Sec.  171.16(b)(5): ``Noncommercial scientific institution \nrequesters will not be charged for search and review time, and the \nfirst 100 pages of the duplication will be provided free of charge.'' \nThe Department will add the following text as the penultimate sentence \nof Sec.  171.16(b)(6): ``A representative of the news media will not be \ncharged for search and review time, and the first 100 pages of the \nduplication will be provided free of charge.''\n    Tenth public comment:\n    The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) is ``primarily \ninterested in the effect the proposed rule will have on public interest \nwaiver FOIA procedures.''\n    Department response:\n    The text of Sec. Sec.  171.16(j)(1)-(4) sets forth the requirements \nfor waiver or reduction of fees. These sections are consistent with the \nFOIA and comply with the OIP Template. The Department is unaware of any \nreason why the revised rule would have any effect on public interest \nwaivers of fees.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department published this rule under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. \n553 and provided for a 60-day public comment period.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    The Department of State, in accordance with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), has reviewed this regulation and, by \napproving it, certifies that this rule will not have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and \ntribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 \nmillion or more in any year, and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined by section 804 of the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.\n\nExecutive Order 12988--Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed this regulation in light of Executive \nOrder 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, minimize litigation, establish \nclear legal standards, and reduce burden.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132--Federalism\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive \nOrder 13132, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient \nfederalism implications to require consultations or warrant the \npreparation of a federalism summary\n\n[[Page 71740]]\n\nimpact statement. The regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 \nregarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and \nactivities do not apply to this regulation.\n\nExecutive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to \nthis rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), and 14094 (Modernizing \nRegulatory Review)\n\n    The Department has considered this rule in light of these Executive \nOrders and affirms that this regulation is consistent with the guidance \ntherein. The Office of Management and Budget has designated this rule \nas significant under E.O. 12866, as amended. The benefits of this \nrulemaking for the public include: providing the public with an up-to-\ndate procedure for requesting information from the Department that is \nconsistent with the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, updating its \nprocedures for communicating electronically with requesters, including \nin its acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to \nallow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests, adding a \nprovision that the Department may divide a multi-part request into \nmultiple requests to facilitate processing, adding a provision for \nconsultation with the Department of Justice's Office of Information \nPolicy with respect to invocation of a FOIA exclusion, providing \ninformation regarding the reasons for a denial and any FOIA exemptions \napplied in denying the request, revising the timeline for submission of \nappeals to 90 days, providing requesters with information regarding \nassistance available from the Department's FOIA Public Liaison and the \ndispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government \nInformation Services (OGIS), updating information on the fees to be \ncharged for FOIA requests, and updating its description of \n``representative of the news media,'' The Department is aware of no \ncost to the public from this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose or revise any reporting or recordkeeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 171\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of Information, \nPrivacy.\n\n0\n1.

For purposes of subparts A and B of this part,\n    Component means the offices that respond directly to requests \nconcerning records under their jurisdiction: the Office of Inspector \nGeneral; the Bureau of Consular Affairs' Directorates for Visa \nServices, Passport Services, and Overseas Citizens Services; the Bureau \nof Diplomatic Security; the Bureau of Global Talent Management; the \nBureau of Medical Services; and the Foreign Service Grievance Board.\n    Control means the Department's legal authority over a record, \ntaking into account the ability of the Department to use and dispose of \nthe record, the intent of the record's creator to retain or relinquish \ncontrol over the record, the extent to which Department personnel have \nread or relied upon the record, and the degree to which the record has \nbeen integrated into the Department's record-keeping systems or files.\n    Department means the United States Department of State, including \nits field offices, Foreign Service posts abroad, and its components. \nThis part does not address FOIA requests to the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID). Requesters should visit USAID's \nwebsite for further information.\n    Record means information regardless of its physical form or \ncharacteristics--including information created, stored, and retrievable \nby electronic means--that is created or obtained by the Department and \nunder the control of the Department at the time of the request, \nincluding information maintained for the Department by an entity under \ngovernment contract for records management purposes. It does not \ninclude records that are not already in existence and that would have \nto be created specifically to respond to a request.\n\n\nSec.  171.2  Types of records maintained.\n\n    Most of the records maintained by the Department pertain to the \nformulation and execution of U.S. foreign policy. The Department also \nmaintains certain records that pertain to individuals, such as \napplications for U.S. passports, applications for U.S. visas, records \non consular assistance given abroad by U.S. Foreign Service posts to \nU.S. citizens\n\n[[Page 71741]]\n\nand lawful permanent residents, and records on Department employees. \nFurther information on the types of records maintained by the \nDepartment may be obtained by reviewing the Department's records \ndisposition schedules, which are available on the Department's FOIA \nwebsite at <a href=\"http://www.foia.state.gov\">www.foia.state.gov</a>.\n\n\nSec.  171.3  Records available on the Department's website.\n\n    (a) Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for \npublic inspection in an electronic format under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) also \nare available on the Department's public website. Included on the \nDepartment's FOIA home page, <a href=\"http://www.foia.state.gov\">www.foia.state.gov</a>, are links to other \nsites where Department information may be available and to the \nDepartment's records disposition schedules. Also available on the FOIA \nwebsite are certain records released by the Department pursuant to \nrequests under the FOIA and compilations of records reviewed and \nreleased in certain special projects. Links to the Department's Privacy \nAct System of Records Notices are available at <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/privacy\">www.state.gov/privacy</a>. \nIn addition, see 22 CFR part 173 regarding release within the United \nStates of public diplomacy program material generated pursuant to the \nU.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, as amended (22 \nU.S.C. 1431, et seq., also referred to as the Smith-Mundt Act).\n    (b) The Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) is \nresponsible for determining which of its records are required to be \nmade publicly available on its website at <a href=\"http://www.stateoig.gov\">www.stateoig.gov</a>. OIG will \nensure that its website of posted records and indices is reviewed and \nupdated on an ongoing basis.\n\n\nSec.  171.4  Requests for information--types and how made.\n\n    (a) General Information. (1) Requests for records made in \naccordance with this part must be made in writing. FOIA requests may be \nmade to the Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS) by \nemail to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#25434a4c44574054504056516556514451400b424a53\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"b1d7ded8d0c3d4c0c4d4c2c5f1c2c5d0c5d49fd6dec7\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, through the Department's FOIA website \n(<a href=\"http://www.foia.state.gov/\">www.foia.state.gov/</a>), by fax to (202) 485-1669, or by mail to the \naddress below. PA requests must be made in writing and signed, and the \nrequester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of \nperjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. See Sec.  171.22(a). PA requests \nmay be made to A/GIS/IPS by email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c5a53555d4e594d49594f487c4f485d4859125b534a\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"d9bfb6b0b8abbca8acbcaaad99aaadb8adbcf7beb6af\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, by fax to \n(202) 485-1669, or by mail. FOIA and PA requests made by mail should be \naddressed to: Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS), \nRoom B-266, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street NW, Washington, DC \n20520.\n    (2) Requests for passport records covered under PA System of \nRecords Notice STATE-26 (available at <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/system-of-records-notices-privacy-office/\">www.state.gov/system-of-records-notices-privacy-office/</a>) must be made in writing, and may be submitted \ndirectly to the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport \nServices directorate (PPT) of the Bureau of Consular Affairs by mailing \nthe request to U.S. Department of State, Office of Law Enforcement \nLiaison, FOIA Officer, 44132 Mercure Circle, P.O. Box 1227, Sterling, \nVA 20166-1227. Requests for passport records and information that do \nnot need to be certified may also be emailed to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#712121255c2104131d18125c373e383023140004140205023102051005145f161e07\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"2575757108755047494c4608636a6c6477405450405651566556514451400b424a53\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n    (3) Requests for records of the OIG must be made in writing, and \nmay be submitted via email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#40262f29210033342134252f29276e272f36\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"fa9c95939bba898e9b8e9f95939dd49d958c\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, by fax to 703-284-\n1866, or by mail addressed to FOIA Officer, Officer of General Counsel, \nOffice of Inspector General, U.S. Department of State, 1700 N Moore \nStreet, Suite 1400, Arlington, VA 22209. Submission by email is \npreferred. Guidance and contact information are available on the OIG's \nwebsite at <a href=\"http://www.stateoig.gov/foiarequest\">www.stateoig.gov/foiarequest</a>.\n    (4) The Office of Information Programs and Services, the Law \nEnforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate, and \nthe OIG are the only Department components authorized to accept FOIA \nand PA requests submitted to the Department.\n    (5) The requester should provide the specific citation to the \nauthority under which he or she is requesting information (e.g., the \nFOIA, the PA, or Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) under the \ncurrent Executive Order on classification). This will facilitate the \nprocessing of the request. When individual U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents request access to records about themselves, the \nDepartment processes responsive records maintained in Privacy Act \nsystems of records under both the FOIA and the PA to provide requesters \nwith the greatest degree of access to the records. Information in such \nrecords will be withheld only if it is exempt from access under both \nlaws; if the information is exempt under only one of the laws, it will \nbe released. Responsive records that are not maintained in a Privacy \nAct system of records are processed only under the FOIA.\n    (6) A requester who requests records about himself or herself, \nincluding passport records, must comply with the verification of \nidentity requirements as set forth in Sec.  171.22 of Subpart C (the \nPrivacy Act Provisions) of this part in order for the request to be \nprocessed under the PA.\n    (7) Where a request for records pertains to a third party or to a \nrequester's own records outside of a request under the Privacy Act, a \nrequester may receive greater access by submitting a notarized \nauthorization signed by the person whose records are requested, or by \nsubmitting a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set \nforth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by the person whose records are requested, \nauthorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by \nsubmitting proof that the third party is deceased (e.g., a copy of a \ndeath certificate or an obituary).\n    (8) The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, section 222(f) \n(8 U.S.C. 1202(f)), provides that the records of the Department of \nState and of diplomatic and consular offices of the United States \npertaining to the issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the \nUnited States must be considered confidential and shall be used only \nfor certain enumerated purposes, including the formulation, amendment, \nadministration, or enforcement of the immigration, nationality, and \nother laws of the United States. As a result, information subject to \nrelease in response to a request for visa records about an individual \nmay be limited. Requests for visa records should include the following \ninformation for the applicant and, if applicable, the petitioner: full \nname, as well as any aliases used; current address; email; and date and \nplace of birth (including city, state, and country). Additional \ninformation describing the records sought will assist the Department in \nproperly identifying the responsive records and in processing the \nrequest. Attorneys or other legal representatives requesting visa \ninformation on behalf of a visa applicant should submit a statement \nwith the request signed by the applicant (and the petitioner if the \nrecords sought pertain to a petition) authorizing release of the \nrequested visa information to the representative. Alternatively, \nrequesters may submit a DS-4240-R to certify their identity or a DS-\n4240-C to provide authorization by the applicant (and the petitioner if \nthe records sought pertain to a petition) to release the requested \ninformation to the legal representative. Forms created by other Federal \nagencies will not be accepted. Other information found in the visa \nfile, such as information submitted as part of the visa application and \ninformation not falling within section 222(f) or another FOIA\n\n[[Page 71742]]\n\nexemption, may be provided to the requester.\n    (b) Description of records sought. Although no particular format is \nrequired, a request must reasonably describe the Department record(s) \nthat the requester seeks. Requesters must describe the records sought \nin sufficient detail to enable agency personnel to locate them with a \nreasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should \ninclude specific information that may assist the Department in \nidentifying the requested record(s), such as the date, title or name, \nauthor, recipient, subject matter, case number, file designation \nreference number, or timeframe. If after receiving a request the \nDepartment determines that the request does not reasonably describe the \nrecords sought, the Department will inform the requester that the \nrequest is insufficient and shall inform the requester what additional \ninformation is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. If \na request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's \nresponse to the request may be delayed. Any records provided in \nresponse to a request will be provided in the form or format requested \nif a releasable form of the records is readily reproducible in that \nform or format. Requesters must provide contact information, such as \ntheir phone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist \nthe Department in communicating with them and providing released \nrecords.\n    (c) Privacy Act versus FOIA. While the Department makes every \neffort to provide the greatest possible access to all requested records \nregardless of the statute(s) under which the information is requested, \nthe following guidance is provided for the benefit of requesters:\n    (1) The Freedom of Information Act applies to requests for records \nconcerning the general activities of government and of the Department \nin particular (see subpart B of this part).\n    (2) The Privacy Act applies to requests from U.S. citizens or \nlawful permanent residents for records about them that are maintained \nby the Department in a system of records retrievable by the \nindividual's name or personal identifier (see subpart C of this part).\n\n\nSec.  171.5  Archival records.\n\n    The Department ordinarily transfers records designated as \nhistorically significant to the National Archives when they are 25 \nyears old. Accordingly, requests for some Department records 25 years \nold or older should be submitted to the National Archives by mail \naddressed to Special Access and FOIA Staff (RD-F), National Archives at \nCollege Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500, College Park, MD 20740-\n6001; by fax to (301) 837-1864; or by email to \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#87f4f7e2e4eee6ebe6e4e4e2f4f4d8e1e8eee6c7e9e6f5e6a9e0e8f1\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"097a796c6a606865686a6a6c7a7a566f6660684967687b68276e667f\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. The Department's website, \n<a href=\"http://www.foia.state.gov\">www.foia.state.gov</a>, has additional information regarding archival \nrecords.\n\nSubpart B--Freedom of Information Act Provisions\n\n\nSec.  171.10  Purpose and scope.\n\n    This subpart contains the rules that the Department follows under \nthe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552. The \nrules should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional \ninformation about access to records and contains the specific \nexemptions that are applicable for withholding information; the Uniform \nFreedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines) (see <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-resources#s5\">www.justice.gov/oip/foia-resources#s5</a>); and information located at <a href=\"http://www.foia.state.gov\">www.foia.state.gov</a>.\n\n\nSec.  171.11  Processing requests.\n\n    (a) In general. (1) The Office of Information Programs and Services \n(A/GIS/IPS) is responsible for initial action on all FOIA requests for \nDepartment records, with two exceptions: requests seeking records under \nthe purview of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), which receives \nand processes requests for OIG records (see Sec.  171.4 (a)(3)); and \nrequests seeking records under the purview of the Law Enforcement \nLiaison Division of the Passport Services directorate of the Bureau of \nConsular Affairs (CA), which receives and processes requests for \ncertain consular records (see Sec.  171.4 (a)(2)).\n    (2) For requests for which A/GIS/IPS is responsible for initial \naction, A/GIS/IPS will issue all initial decisions on whether a request \nis valid (or has subsequently been perfected) and whether to grant or \ndeny requests for a fee waiver or for expedited processing.\n    (3) After A/GIS/IPS takes initial action, all requests for records \ncoming under the jurisdiction of the following components are processed \nby those components, although A/GIS/IPS may provide review and \ncoordination support to these components in some situations: the \nDirectorates for Visa Services, Passport Services, and Overseas \nCitizens Services, in the Bureau of Consular Affairs; the Bureau of \nDiplomatic Security; the Bureau of Global Talent Management; and the \nBureau of Medical Services. Additionally, the Foreign Service Grievance \nBoard (FSGB), as an independent body, processes all FOIA requests \nseeking access to its records and responds directly to requesters.\n    (b) Receipt of request. The Department is in receipt of a request \nwhen the request is received by A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT, depending on \nwhich office is the proper recipient. At that time, the Department must \nsend an acknowledgement letter to the requester that identifies the \ndate of receipt of the request in the proper office (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or \nPPT), and the case tracking number. When one of these offices \ndetermines that a request was misdirected within the Department, that \noffice must promptly route the request to the proper office(s) within \nthe Department.\n    (c) Cut-off date and exclusions. In determining which records are \nresponsive to a request, the Department ordinarily will include only \nrecords in its possession as of the date of initiation of the search \nfor responsive records, unless the requester has specified an earlier \ncut-off date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the \nFOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a \nrequest.\n    (d) Consultation, referral, and coordination. When reviewing \nrecords located in response to a request, the component processing the \nrequest will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government \nis better able to determine whether the record is exempt from \ndisclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the component must \nproceed in one of the following ways:\n    (1) Consultation. When records originated with the Department, but \ncontain within them information of interest to another agency or other \nFederal Government office, the component processing the request should \ntypically consult with that other entity prior to making a release \ndetermination.\n    (2) Referral. (i) When the component processing the request \nbelieves that a different Department component or other Federal \nGovernment agency is better able to determine whether to disclose the \nrecord, the component processing the request typically should refer the \nresponsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to \nthat component or agency, as long as the referral is to an entity \nsubject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record \nwill be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. \nHowever, if the component processing the request and the originating \nagency jointly agree that the former is in the better position to \nrespond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a \nconsultation.\n\n[[Page 71743]]\n\n    (ii) Whenever the component processing the request refers any part \nof the responsibility for responding to a request to another entity, \nthe component must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record \nthat it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the \nrequester of the name(s) of the entity to which the record was \nreferred, including that entity's FOIA contact information.\n    (3) Coordination. The standard referral procedure is not \nappropriate where disclosure of the identity of the component or agency \nto which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by \nan applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal \nprivacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law \nenforcement component responding to a request for records on a living \nthird party locates within its files records originating with a law \nenforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement \ninterest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose \nthat law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of \nthe personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if a component \nlocates within its files material originating with an Intelligence \nCommunity agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is \nclassified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give \nattribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency \ncould cause national security harm. In such instances, in order to \navoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the \ncomponent that received the request should coordinate with the \noriginating component or agency to seek its views on the whether the \nrecord may be disclosed. The release determination for the record that \nis the subject of the coordination will be conveyed to the requester by \nthe component that originally received the request.\n    (e) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All \nconsultations and referrals received by the Department will be handled \naccording to the date that the perfected FOIA request was received by \nthe first agency.\n    (f) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. The \nDepartment may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate, \nreduce, or streamline the need for consultations or referrals for \nparticular types of records.\n\n\nSec.  171.12  Timing of responses to requests.\n\n    (a) In general. The Department ordinarily will respond to requests \nin the order received. In instances involving misdirected requests that \nare re-routed pursuant to Sec.  171.11 (b), the response time will \ncommence on the date that the request is received by the proper office \nthat is designated to receive requests (A/GIS/IPS, OIG or PPT), but in \nany event not later than 10 working days after the request is first \nreceived by any of these three offices.\n    (b) Multi-track processing. The Department has a specific track for \nrequests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the \nstandards that are set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. An \nintake office (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT) may also designate additional \nprocessing tracks that, for example, distinguish between simple and \nmore complex requests based on the estimated amount of work and/or time \nneeded to process the request. Among the factors that may also be \nconsidered are the number of records requested, the number of pages \ninvolved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or \nreferrals. The Department must advise requesters of the track in which \ntheir request falls and, when appropriate, should offer the requesters \nan opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a \ndifferent processing track.\n    (c) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for \nprocessing a request cannot be met because of unusual circumstances, as \ndefined in the FOIA, and the Department extends the time limit on that \nbasis, the Department must, before expiration of the 20-day period to \nrespond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances \ninvolved. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Department \nmust, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an \nopportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period \nfor processing the original or a modified request. The Department must \nmake available its designated FOIA contact and FOIA Public Liaison for \nthis purpose (see <a href=\"http://foia.state.gov/contact/\">foia.state.gov/contact/</a>). In the written notice to \nthe requester, the Department must also alert the requester to the \navailability of the Office of Government Information Services to \nprovide dispute resolution services.\n    (d) Expedited processing. (1) Requests shall receive expedited \nprocessing when a requester demonstrates that a compelling need for the \ninformation exists. A compelling need is deemed to exist when the \nrequester can demonstrate one of the following:\n    (i) Failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could \nreasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or \nphysical safety of an individual;\n    (ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged \nin disseminating information, there exists an urgency to inform the \npublic concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity; or\n    (iii) Failure to release the information would impair substantial \ndue process rights or harm substantial humanitarian interests.\n    (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of \nthe initial request for records or at any later time. Requests for \nexpedited processing must be submitted to the office responsible for \nreceiving the FOIA request (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT). When making a \nrequest for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the \nrequest must be submitted to A/GIS/IPS, or OIG in the case of appeals \nof OIG decisions (see Sec.  171.15). A Department FOIA office that \nreceives a misdirected request for expedited processing must forward it \npromptly to the correct office responsible for receiving requests (A/\nGIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT) for its determination. The time period for making \nthe determination on the request for expedited processing commences on \nthe date that the correct office receives the request, provided that \nthe Department will be considered to have received the request for \nexpedited processing no more than 10 working days after the request for \nexpedited processing is received by A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT.\n    (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a \nstatement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the \nbasis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, \nunder paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a \nfull-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is \na person whose primary professional activity or occupation is \ninformation dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole \noccupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency \nto inform the public about the government activity involved in the \nrequest--one that extends beyond the public's right to know about \ngovernment activity generally. The existence of numerous articles \npublished on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the \nrequirement that there be an ``urgency to inform'' the public on the \ntopic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Department may \nwaive the formal certification requirement.\n    (4) A notice of the determination whether to grant expedited \nprocessing must be provided to the requester within 10 calendar days of \nthe date of\n\n[[Page 71744]]\n\nthe receipt of the request for expedited processing in the appropriate \noffice (whether A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT). If expedited processing is \ngranted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing \ntrack for expedited requests, and processed as soon as practicable. A \ndenial of a request for expedited processing may be appealed within 90 \ncalendar days of the date of the Department's letter denying the \nrequest. A decision in writing on the appeal will be issued within 10 \ncalendar days of the receipt of the appeal.\n\n\nSec.  171.13  Responses to requests.\n\n    (a) In general. The Department will, to the extent practicable, \ncommunicate with requesters having access to the internet using \nelectronic means, such as email or a web portal.\n    (b) Acknowledgment of requests. The Department must acknowledge the \nrequest in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if \nit will take longer than 10 working days to process. The Department \nmust include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records \nsought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests. \nThe Department may in its discretion divide a multi-part request into \nmultiple requests in order to facilitate processing.\n    (c) Estimated dates of completion and interim responses. Upon \nrequest, the Department will provide an estimated date by which the \nDepartment expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request \ninvolves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple \nlocations, the agency may provide interim responses, releasing the \nrecords on a rolling basis.\n    (d) Grants of requests. Once the Department makes a determination \nto grant a request in full or in part, it must notify the requester in \nwriting. The Department also must inform the requester of any fees \ncharged under Sec.  171.16 and must disclose the requested records to \nthe requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The \nDepartment must inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA \nPublic Liaison to offer assistance.\n    (e) Adverse determinations of requests. If the Department makes an \nadverse determination denying a request in any respect, it must notify \nthe requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, \nor denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is \nexempt from disclosure, in whole or in part; the request does not \nreasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is \nnot a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, \ncannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is \nnot readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. \nAdverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee \nwaiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.\n    (f) Content of denial. The denial must be signed by the head of the \ncomponent processing the request, or designee, and must include:\n    (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for \nthe denial;\n    (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any \nFOIA exemptions applied in denying the request;\n    (3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information \nwithheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of \nestimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is \notherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed \nin part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by \nan applicable exemption;\n    (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec.  171.15 \nand a description of the requirements set forth therein; and\n    (5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available \nfrom the Department's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution \nservices offered by the Office of Government Information Services of \nthe National Archives and Records Administration.\n    (g) Markings on released documents. Markings on released documents \nmust be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part \nmust be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the \nexemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm \nan interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the \ninformation deleted must also be indicated on the record, if \ntechnically feasible.\n    (h) Use of record exclusions. (1) In the event that the Department \nidentifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the \nrequirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), A/GIS/IPS or OIG \nmust confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information \nPolicy to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.\n    (2) Any time the Department invokes an exclusion, it must maintain \nan administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of \nthe exclusion by OIP.\n\n\nSec.  171.14  Confidential commercial information.\n\n    (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of \nthis section:\n    Confidential commercial information means commercial or financial \ninformation obtained by the Department from a submitter that may be \nexempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \n552(b)(4).\n    Submitter means any person or entity from which the Department \nobtains confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly. \nThe term includes corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships; \nstate, local, and tribal governments; foreign governments; NGOs; and \neducational institutions. This term does not include another Federal \nGovernment entity.\n    (b) Designation of confidential commercial information. A submitter \nof confidential commercial information must use good-faith efforts to \ndesignate by appropriate markings at the time of submission any \nportions of its submission that it considers exempt from disclosure \nunder FOIA Exemption 4. These designations expire ten years after the \ndate of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides \njustification for, a longer designation period.\n    (c) Notice to submitters. (1) The Department must provide a \nsubmitter with prompt written notice whenever records containing its \nconfidential commercial information are requested under the FOIA if the \nagency determines that it may be required to disclose the records, \nprovided:\n    (i) The information has been designated in good faith by the \nsubmitter as information considered exempt from disclosure under \nExemption 4; or\n    (ii) The Department has reason to believe that the requested \ninformation may be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 but has not \nyet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.\n    (2) The notice must either describe the confidential commercial \ninformation requested or include a copy of the requested records or \nrecord portions containing the information.\n    (d) When notice is not required. The notice requirements of this \nsection do not apply if:\n    (1) The Department determines that the information is exempt from \ndisclosure under the FOIA and, therefore, will not be disclosed;\n    (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been \nofficially made available to the public;\n\n[[Page 71745]]\n\n    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other \nthan the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the \nrequirements of Executive Order 12600; or\n    (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of \nthis section appears obviously frivolous. In such a case, the \nDepartment must give the submitter written notice of any final decision \nto disclose the information a reasonable number of days prior to a \nspecified disclosure date.\n    (e) Opportunity to object to disclosure. The Department must allow \na submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in \nparagraph (c) of this section and must specify that time period in the \nnotice. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should \nprovide the Department a detailed written statement that specifies all \ngrounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption \nof the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for \nnondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information \nconstitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that \nis privileged or confidential. If a submitter fails to respond to the \nnotice within the time specified in it, the submitter will be \nconsidered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The \nDepartment is not required to consider any information received after \nany disclosure decision. Information provided by a submitter under this \nsubpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n    (f) Notice of intent to disclose. The Department will consider a \nsubmitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in \ndeciding whether to disclose confidential commercial information. \nWhenever the Department decides to disclose information over the \nobjection of a submitter, it must give the submitter written notice, \nwhich must include:\n    (1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's \ndisclosure objections was not sustained;\n    (2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of \nthe records as the Department intends to release them; and\n    (3) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time \nafter the notice.\n    (g) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit \nseeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial \ninformation, the Department must promptly notify the submitter.\n    (h) Notice to requester. The Department must notify the requester \nwhenever it provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to \nobject to disclosure; whenever it notifies a submitter of its intent to \ndisclose requested information; and whenever a submitter files a \nlawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of the requested information.\n\n\nSec.  171.15  Administrative appeals.\n\n    (a) Requirements for making an appeal. (1) Requesters may appeal \nany adverse determinations made on their FOIA request by the \nDepartment. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in Sec.  \n171.13(e). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be \nconsidered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic \nsubmissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the \nadverse determination. The appeal must clearly identify the component's \ndetermination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. \nTo facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal \nletter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, \n``Freedom of Information Act Appeal.''\n    (2) To appeal any adverse determinations made by A/GIS/IPS or a \ncomponent other than OIG, requesters must submit an administrative \nappeal to the A/GIS/IPS FOIA Appeals Office using any of the following \nmethods: by mail to the Appeals Officer, Office of Information Programs \nand Services (A/GIS/IPS), Room B-266, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C \nStreet NW, Washington, DC 20520; by fax to (202) 485-1718; or by email \nto <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#db9d94929a9aababbebab7a89ba8afbaafbef5bcb4ad\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"54121b1d15152424313538271427203520317a333b22\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n    (3) To appeal any adverse determinations made by OIG, requesters \nmust submit an administrative appeal to OIG via email to \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3b5d54525a7b484f5a4f5e54525c155c544d\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"ee8881878fae9d9a8f9a8b818789c0898198\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, by fax to 703-284-1866, or by mail addressed to the \nFOIA Officer, Officer of General Counsel, Office of Inspector General, \nU.S. Department of State, 1700 N Moore Street, Suite 1400, Arlington, \nVA 22209. Contact information for OIG is available on OIG's FOIA \nwebsite at <a href=\"http://www.stateoig.gov/foiaappeals\">www.stateoig.gov/foiaappeals</a>. For those cases in which both \nA/GIS/IPS and OIG provided written denials to the requester, the \nrequester may administratively appeal to both A/GIS/IPS and OIG and \neach office will handle its respective portion of the appeal.\n    (4) To appeal any adverse determinations made by the FSGB, \nrequesters must submit an administrative appeal to A/GIS/IPS using the \nmethods listed above in paragraph (2). A/GIS/IPS will assign a tracking \nnumber to the appeal and forward it to the FSGB, which is an \nindependent body, for adjudication.\n    (b) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The A/GIS/IPS Director or designee \nwill act on behalf of the Assistant Secretary for Administration on all \nappeals of A/GIS/IPS FOIA determinations under this section. Likewise, \nthe General Counsel of OIG or his/her designee will act on behalf of \nthe Inspector General on all appeals of OIG FOIA determinations under \nthis section.\n    (2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request \nbecomes a matter of FOIA litigation.\n    (c) Decisions on appeals. The Department must provide its decision \non an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds the Department's \ndetermination in whole or in part must include a brief statement of the \nreason for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The \ndecision must inform the requester that the decision represents the \nfinal decision of the Department; must advise the requester of the \nstatutory right to file a lawsuit; and must inform the requester of the \ndispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government \nInformation Services of the National Archives and Records \nAdministration (OGIS) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If \na decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be \nnotified in writing. The appropriate component will then further \nprocess the request in accordance with that appeal determination and \nrespond directly to the requester.\n    (d) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS. \nDispute resolution is a voluntary process. If a component agrees to \nparticipate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it \nwill actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to \nresolve the dispute.\n    (e) When appeal is required. Before seeking review by a court of \nthe Department's adverse determination, a requester generally must \nfirst submit a timely administrative appeal.\n\n\nSec.  171.16  Fees to be charged.\n\n    (a) In general. The Department will charge fees for processing \nrequests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this \nsection and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, \nthe FOIA establishes three categories of requesters: (1) commercial use \nrequesters, (2) non-commercial scientific or educational institutions \nor news media requesters, and (3) all other requesters. Different fees \nare assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee \nwaiver. The Department considers fee waivers in accordance with the \nrequirements set forth below. To resolve\n\n[[Page 71746]]\n\nany issues that arise under this section, the Department may contact a \nrequester for additional information. The Department must use the most \nefficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for records \nmade under the FOIA. The Department shall attempt to notify the \nrequester if fees are estimated to exceed $25.00, unless the requester \nhas expressed a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. \nSuch notification shall include a breakdown of the fees for search, \nreview, and duplication. The Department ordinarily will collect all \napplicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. \nRequesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the \nTreasury of the United States, or by another method as determined by \nthe Department.\n    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n    Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, the Department will \ncharge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been \ngranted under paragraph (j) of this section. Because the fee amounts \nprovided below already account for the direct costs associated with a \ngiven fee type, the Department should not add any additional costs to \ncharges calculated under this section.\n    Commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a \nuse or purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, \nwhich can include furthering those interests through litigation. The \nDepartment's decision to place a requester in the commercial use \ncategory will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's \nintended use of the information. The Department will notify requesters \nof their placement in this category.\n    Direct costs are those expenses the Department incurs in searching \nfor, duplicating, and, in the case of commercial use requests, \nreviewing records in response to a FOIA request. For example, direct \ncosts include the salary of the employee performing the work (i.e., the \nbasic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to \ncover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other \nelectronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. The term does \nnot include overhead expenses such as the costs of space and of heating \nor lighting of a facility.\n    Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the \ninformation contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. \nCopies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic \nrecords, among others.\n    Educational institution is any school that operates a program of \nscholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the \nrequest is made in connection with the requester's role at the \neducational institution. The Department may seek verification from the \nrequester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research. The \nDepartment will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n    Non-commercial scientific institution is an institution that is not \noperated on a ``commercial'' basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of \nthis section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of \nconducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to \npromote any particular product or industry. A requester in this \ncategory must show that the request is authorized by and is made under \nthe auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are \nsought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. \nNoncommercial scientific institution requesters will not be charged for \nsearch and review time, and the first 100 pages of the duplication will \nbe provided free of charge. The Department will advise requesters of \ntheir placement in this category.\n    Representative of the news media is any person or entity that \ngathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, \nuses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct \nwork, and distributes that work to an audience. The term ``news'' means \ninformation that is about current events or that would be of current \ninterest to the public. Examples of news media entities include \ntelevision or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large \nand publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their \nproducts available through a variety of means to the general public, \nincluding news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A \nrequest for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the \nrequester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. Freelance \njournalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication \nthrough a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of \nthe news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest \nevidence that publication is expected; however, the Department shall \nalso consider a requester's past publication record in making this \ndetermination. A representative of the news media will not be charged \nfor search and review time, and the first 100 pages of the duplication \nwill be provided free of charge. The Department will advise requesters \nof their placement in this category.\n    Review is the examination of a record located in response to a \nrequest to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from \ndisclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, \nsuch as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for \ndisclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking \nthe appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a \nrecord ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time \nspent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure \nmade by a confidential commercial information submitter under Sec.  \n171.14 but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or \npolicy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n    Search is the process of looking for, identifying, and retrieving \nrecords or information responsive to a request. Search time includes \npage-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within \nrecords and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve \ninformation from electronic records.\n    (i) Requests made by educational institutions, non-commercial \nscientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not \nsubject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other \nrequesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (j) of this \nsection. The Department may properly charge for time spent searching \neven if responsive records are not located, or if records are \ndetermined to be entirely exempt from disclosure.\n    (ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested \nrecords, the fees shall be as stated at the following website: \n<a href=\"http://foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx\">foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx</a> (section VII, ``Fees'') and \n<a href=\"http://www.stateoig.gov/foiafees\">www.stateoig.gov/foiafees</a> for OIG requested records.\n    (iii) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by \nthe Department at a Federal records center operated by the National \nArchives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department will charge \nadditional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate \nSchedule established by NARA.\n    (2) Review. The Department will charge review fees to requesters \nwho make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in \nconnection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review \nconducted to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular \nrecord or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the \nadministrative appeal stage of\n\n[[Page 71747]]\n\nexemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a \nparticular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated \nwith the Department's re-review of the records in order to consider the \nuse of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees \nshall be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under \nparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.\n    (3) Duplication. The Department will charge duplication fees to all \nrequesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this \nsection. The Department must honor a requester's preference for \nreceiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily \nreproducible by the Department in the form or format requested. The \nDepartment charges the direct costs of producing the copy, including \noperator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply \nwith a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic \nformat, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with \nscanning those materials. Duplication fees are as stated at the \nfollowing website: <a href=\"http://foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx\">foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx</a> (section VII, \n``Fees'').\n    (d) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) The Department will not \ncharge search fees for requests by educational institutions, non-\ncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news \nmedia, unless the records are sought for a commercial use.\n    (2) If the Department fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits \nin which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in \nthe instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) \nof this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described \nin paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.\n    (i) If the Department has determined that unusual circumstances as \ndefined by the FOIA apply and the agency provided timely written notice \nto the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with \nthe time limit is excused for an additional 10 days.\n    (ii) If the Department has determined that unusual circumstances as \ndefined by the FOIA apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to \nrespond to the request, the Department may charge search fees, or, in \nthe case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, \nmay charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The \nDepartment must have provided timely written notice of unusual \ncircumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, and the \nDepartment must have discussed with the requester via written mail, \nemail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to \ndo so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the \nrequest in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception \nis satisfied, the Department may charge all applicable fees incurred in \nthe processing of the request.\n    (iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances \nexist as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits \nshall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n    (3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the \nDepartment must provide without charge:\n    (i) the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for \nother media); and\n    (ii) the first two hours of search.\n    (4) When, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost \nequivalent) and the first two hours of search, the total fee calculated \nunder paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less, no fee will be \ncharged.\n    (5) Apart from the stated provisions regarding waiver or reduction \nof fees, see paragraph (j) of this section, the Department may in its \nsole discretion decide to not assess fees or to reduce them if it is in \nthe best interests of the government not to do so.\n    (e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When the \nDepartment determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in \naccordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Department must \nnotify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, \nincluding a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, \nunless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as \nthose anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated \nreadily, the Department will advise the requester accordingly. If the \nrequest is not for commercial use, the notice will specify that the \nrequester is entitled to the statutory entitlement of 100 pages of \nduplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, \ntwo hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester \nwhether those entitlements have been provided.\n    (2) In cases in which the Department has notified the requester \nthat the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request \nwill not be considered received and further work will not be completed \nuntil the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated \ntotal fee, or designates an amount of fees the requester is willing to \npay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet \nbeen provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates \nthat the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the \nstatutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or \ndesignation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact \ndollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Department is not \nrequired to accept payments in installments.\n    (3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some \ndesignated amount of fees, but the Department estimates that the total \nfee will exceed that amount, the Department will toll the processing of \nthe request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in \nexcess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. \nThe Department will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the \namount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. \nOnce the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where \nit was at the date of the notification.\n    (4) The Department must make available its FOIA Public Liaison or \nother FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a \nrequest to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n    (f) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide \nspecial services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of \nadministrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service \nshall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that \nrecords are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same \ndocument, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n    (g) Charging interest. The Department may charge interest on any \nunpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date the bill was \nsent to the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate \nprovided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall accrue from the date of the \nbilling until payment is received by the Department. The fact that a \nfee has been received by the Department within the thirty-day grace \nperiod, even if not processed, shall stay the accrual of interest. The \nDepartment must follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of \n1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its \nadministrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting \nagencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n    (h) Aggregating requests. When the Department reasonably believes \nthat a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is \nattempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the \npurpose of avoiding fees, the Department may aggregate those\n\n[[Page 71748]]\n\nrequests and charge accordingly. The Department may presume that \nmultiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been \nmade in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, \ncomponents will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis \nfor determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the \ncircumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters \ncannot be aggregated.\n    (i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described \nin paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, the Department cannot \nrequire a requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced \nor continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed \n(i.e., payment before copies are sent to the requester) is not advance \npayment.\n    (2) When the Department estimates or determines that a total fee to \nbe charged under this section will exceed $250, it may require that the \nrequester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire \nanticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Department \nmay elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it \nreceives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with \na history of prompt payment.\n    (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay FOIA fees to any \ncomponent within 30 calendar days of the date of its billing, the \nDepartment may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus \nany applicable interest on that prior request, and to make an advance \npayment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the Department \nbegins to process a new request or continues to process a pending \nrequest or any appeal from that requester. Where the Department has a \nreasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the \nrequester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may \nrequire that the requester provide proof of identity. Additionally, if \na requester has failed to pay FOIA fees to another U.S. Government \nagency in a FOIA case, the Department may require proof that such fee \nhas been paid before processing a new or pending request from that \nrequester.\n    (4) In cases in which the Department requires advance payment, the \nrequest will not be considered received and further work will not be \ncompleted until the required payment is received. If the requester does \nnot pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of \nthe Department's fee determination, the request will be closed.\n    (j) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Requesters \nmay seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application \ndemonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the \npublic interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to \npublic understanding of the operations or activities of the government \nand is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n    (2) The Department must furnish records responsive to a request \nwithout charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all \navailable information, that the factors described in paragraphs \n(j)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:\n    (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the \noperations or activities of the government. The subject of the request \nmust concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal \nGovernment with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or \nattenuated.\n    (ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to \ncontribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or \nactivities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are \nmet:\n    (A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully \ninformative about government operations or activities. The disclosure \nof information that already is in the public domain, in either the same \nor a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully \ninformative if nothing new would be added to the public's \nunderstanding.\n    (B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a \nreasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as \nopposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's \nexpertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and \nintention to effectively convey information to the public shall be \nconsidered. The Department will presume that a representative of the \nnews media satisfies this consideration.\n    (iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial \ninterest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the \ninformation is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, \nthe Department will consider the following factors:\n    (A) The Department must identify whether the requester has any \ncommercial interest that would be furthered by the requested \ndisclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or \nprofit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide \nexplanatory information regarding this consideration.\n    (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Department \nmust determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the \nrequest. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the \nrequirement of paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are \nsatisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest \nfurthered by the request. The Department ordinarily will presume that \nwhen a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of \nparagraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not \nprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to \ndata brokers or others who merely compile and market government \ninformation for direct economic return will not be presumed to \nprimarily serve the public interest.\n    (3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the \nrequirements for a waiver or reduction of fees, a waiver or reduction \nmust be granted for those records.\n    (4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when \nthe request is first submitted to the Department and should address the \ncriteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request \nat a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or \non administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay \nfees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is \ndenied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the \nfee waiver request was received.\n\n\nSec.  171.17  Preservation of records.\n\n    The Department must preserve all correspondence pertaining to the \nrequests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all \nrequested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized \npursuant to title 44 of the United States Code and applicable records \ndisposition schedules, including the General Records Schedule 4.2 of \nthe National Archives and Records Administration. The Department must \nnot dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a \npending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.\n\nSubpart C--Privacy Act Provisions\n\n\nSec.  171.20  Purpose and scope.\n\n    This subpart contains the rules that the Department follows when \nimplementing certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (PA), as \namended, 5 U.S.C. 552a. These rules should be read together with the \nstatute. The rules\n\n[[Page 71749]]\n\nin this subpart apply to all records in systems of records maintained \nby the Department that are retrieved by an individual's name or \npersonal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals \nmay request access to records about themselves, request amendment or \ncorrection of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures \nof those records by the Department. If any records retrieved pursuant \nto an access request under the PA are found to be exempt from access \nunder that Act, they will be processed for possible disclosure under \nthe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. No \nfees shall be charged when an individual requests access to or \namendment of his or her own PA records.\n\n\nSec.  171.21  Definitions.\n\n    As used in this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:\n    Individual means a citizen or a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of \nthe United States.\n    Maintain includes maintain, collect, use, or disseminate.\n    Record means any item, collection, or grouping of information about \nan individual that is maintained by the Department and that contains \nthe individual's name or the identifying number, symbol, or other \nidentifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a \nfingerprint, voice print, or photograph.\n    System of records means a group of any records under the control of \nthe Department from which information is retrieved by the name of an \nindividual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying \nparticular assigned to an individual.\n\n\nSec.  171.22  Request for access to records.\n\n    (a) In general. Requests for access to records under the PA must be \nmade in writing and sent to the Office of Information Programs and \nServices, the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services \ndirectorate within the Bureau of Consular Affairs, or the Office of \nInspector General at the addresses given in Sec.  171.4. The Director \nof the Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS) is \nresponsible for acting on all PA requests for Department records except \nfor requests received directly by the Office of Inspector General, \nwhich processes its own requests for information, and the Law \nEnforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate \nwithin the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which receives directly and \nprocesses its own PA requests for information as described in PA System \nof Record Notice STATE-26. All processing of PA requests coming under \nthe jurisdiction of the Directorates for Visa Services and Overseas \nCitizens Services in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, the Bureau of \nDiplomatic Security, the Bureau of Global Talent Management, the Bureau \nof Medical Services, and the Foreign Service Grievance Board (FSGB) are \nhandled by those bureaus or offices.\n    (b) Description of records sought. Requests for access should \ndescribe the requested record(s) in sufficient detail to permit \nidentification of the record(s). At a minimum, requests should include \nthe individual's full name (including maiden name, if appropriate) and \nany other names used, current complete mailing address, and date and \nplace of birth (city, state, and country). Helpful information includes \nthe approximate time period of the record and the circumstances that \ngive the individual reason to believe that the Department maintains a \nrecord under the individual's name or personal identifier, and, if \nknown, the system of records in which the record is maintained. In \ncertain instances, it may be necessary for the Department to request \nadditional information from the requester, either to ensure a full \nsearch, or to ensure that a record retrieved does in fact pertain to \nthe individual.\n    (c) Verification of personal identity. The Department will require \nreasonable identification of individuals requesting records about \nthemselves under the PA's access provisions to ensure that records are \nonly accessed by the proper persons. Requesters must state their full \nname, current address, citizenship or legal permanent resident alien \nstatus, and date and place of birth (city, state, and country). The \nrequest must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either \nnotarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. \nIf the requester seeks records under another name the requester has \nused, a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the requester has \nalso used the other name must be included. Requesters seeking access to \ncopies of the Passport Services' passport records must meet the \nrequirements in paragraph (d) of this section.\n    (d) Special requirements for passport records. Given the sensitive \nnature of passport records and their use, requesters seeking access to \ncopies of passport records from Passport Services under the PA must \nsubmit a letter that is either notarized or made under penalty of \nperjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, which includes the full name at \nbirth and any subsequent name changes of the individual whose records \nare being requested (if submitting the request on behalf of a minor, \nprovide the representative's full name as well); the date and place of \nbirth of the individual whose records are being requested; the \nrequester's current mailing address; and, if available, daytime \ntelephone number and email address; the date or estimated date the \npassport(s) was issued; the passport number of the person whose records \nare being sought, if known; and any other information that will help to \nlocate the records. The requester must also include a clear copy of \nboth sides of the requester's valid government-issued photo \nidentification, e.g., a driver's license.\n    (e) Authorized third party access. The Department shall process all \nproperly authorized third party requests, as described in this section, \nunder the PA. In the absence of proper authorization from the \nindividual to whom the records pertain, the Department will process \nthird party requests under the FOIA. The Department's forms DS-4240-R \nand DS-4240-C, respectively, may be used to certify identity and \nprovide third party authorization. Forms created by other Federal \nagencies will not be accepted.\n    (1) Parents and guardians of minor children. Upon presentation of \nacceptable documentation of the parental or guardian relationship, a \nparent or guardian of a U.S. citizen or LPR minor (an unmarried person \nunder the age of 18) may, on behalf of the minor, request records under \nthe PA pertaining to the minor. In any case, U.S. citizen or LPR minors \nmay request such records on their own behalf. When making a request as \nthe parent or guardian of a minor child, for access to records about \nthat individual, a requester must establish: (1) the identity of the \nindividual who is the subject of the records, by stating the name, \ncurrent address, date and place of birth; (2) the requester's own \nidentity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section; (3) that the \nrequester is the parent of that individual, which the requester may \nprove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing \nparentage, or by providing a court order establishing guardianship; and \n(4) that the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making \nthe request.\n    (2) Guardians of incompetent adults. A guardian of an individual \nwho has been declared by a court to be incompetent may act for and on \nbehalf of the incompetent individual upon presentation of appropriate \ndocumentation of the guardian relationship.\n    (i) Verification of guardianship of incompetent adult. When making \na\n\n[[Page 71750]]\n\nrequest as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be \nincompetent, for access to records about that individual, a requester \nmust establish: (1) the identity of the individual who is the subject \nof the records, by stating the name, current address, date and place of \nbirth; (2) the requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) \nof this section; (3) that the requester is the guardian of that \nindividual, which the requester may prove by providing a copy of a \ncourt order establishing guardianship; and (4) that the requester is \nacting on behalf of that individual in making the request.\n    (ii) Authorized representatives or designees. When an individual \nwishes to authorize the Department to permit a third party access to \nhis or her records, the individual to whom the records pertain must \nsubmit, in addition to the identity verification information described \nin paragraph (c) (or paragraph (d) of this section if the request is \nfor passport records), a signed statement from the individual to whom \nthe records pertain, either notarized or made under penalty of perjury \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, giving the Department authorization to \nrelease records about the individual to the third party. The designated \nthird party must submit identity verification information described in \nparagraph (c). Third party requesters seeking access to copies of the \nPassport Office's records must submit a clear copy of both sides of a \nvalid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver's license) \nin addition to the other information described above.\n    (f) Referrals and consultations. If the Department determines that \nrecords retrieved as responsive to the request were created by another \nagency, it ordinarily will refer the records to the originating agency \nfor direct response to the requester. If the Department determines that \nDepartment records retrieved as responsive to the request are of \ninterest to another agency, it may consult with the other agency before \nresponding to the request. The Department may make agreements with \nother agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for \nparticular types of records.\n    (g) Records relating to civil actions. Nothing in this subpart \nentitles an individual to access any information compiled in reasonable \nanticipation of a civil action or proceeding.\n    (h) Time limits. The Department will acknowledge the request \npromptly and furnish the requested information as soon as possible \nthereafter.\n\n\nSec.  171.23  Request to amend or correct records.\n\n    (a) An individual has the right to request that the Department \namend a record pertaining to the individual that the individual \nbelieves is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.\n    (b) Requests to amend records must be in writing and mailed or \ndelivered to A/GIS/IPS or OIG at the address given in Sec.  171.4, with \nATTENTION: PRIVACY ACT AMENDMENT REQUEST written on the envelope. A/\nGIS/IPS or OIG will coordinate the review of the request with the \nappropriate offices under its purview. The Department will require \nverification of personal identity as provided in Sec.  171.22(c) before \nit will initiate action to amend a record. Amendment requests should \ncontain, at a minimum, identifying information needed to locate the \nrecord in question, a description of the specific correction requested, \nand an explanation of why the existing record is not accurate, \nrelevant, timely, or complete. The request must be signed, and the \nrequester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of \nperjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. The requester should submit as much \npertinent documentation, other information, and explanation as possible \nto support the request for amendment.\n    (c) All requests for amendments to records shall be acknowledged \nwithin 10 working days.\n    (d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the \nDepartment shall review the record to determine if it is accurate, \nrelevant, timely, and complete.\n    (e) If the Department agrees with an individual's request to amend \na record, it shall:\n    (1) Advise the individual in writing of its decision;\n    (2) Amend the record accordingly; and\n    (3) If an accounting of disclosure has been made, advise all \nprevious recipients of the record of the amendment and its substance.\n    (f) If the Department denies an individual's request to amend a \nrecord, it shall advise the individual in writing of its decision and \nthe reason for the refusal, and the procedures for the individual to \nrequest further review. See Sec.  171.25.\n\n\nSec.  171.24  Request for an accounting of record disclosures.\n\n    (a) How made.

In utilizing these \nexemptions, the Department is exempting only those portions of systems \nthat are necessary for the proper functioning of the Department and \nthat are consistent with the PA. Where compliance would not interfere \nwith or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it \nmay be appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the \ninformation collected, the applicable exemption may be waived, either \npartially or totally, by the Department or the OIG, in the sole \ndiscretion of the Department or the OIG, as appropriate. Records exempt \nunder 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) by the originator of the record remain \nexempt if subsequently incorporated into any Department system of \nrecords, provided the reason for the exemption remains valid and \nnecessary.\n    (a) General exemptions.

The 2019 IFR implemented such amendments based on an intention to more closely align with the standards then applied by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") to determine inadmissibility on public charge grounds.

In declining to finalize the regulatory amendments made by the 2019 IFR, the Department will instead revert to regulatory text that was in place prior to the publication of the 2019 IFR and will continue to apply the guidance set out in the Foreign Affairs Manual (\"FAM\"). This regulatory text, together with the existing FAM guidance, more closely aligns with the current DHS standards, and the Department anticipates that it will subsequently initiate new notice-and-comment rulemaking in light of the 2022 DHS Final Rule.",

    "supplementary_information": "I. Background\n\nA. Legal Authority\n\n    Under section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(``INA''), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), a noncitizen is inadmissible to the \nUnited States, and therefore ineligible for a visa, if, in the opinion \nof the consular officer at the time of the application for a visa, the \napplicant is likely at any time to become a ``public charge.'' \\1\\ The \nDepartment implements the public charge ground of inadmissibility with \nrespect to visa ineligibility through regulations at 22 CFR 40.41.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ DHS also applies section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4), to noncitizens seeking admission to the United States at \nor between ports of entry, or in reviewing applications for \nadjustment of status. Additionally, the Department of Justice \n(``DOJ'') applies this statute with respect to noncitizens in \nimmigration court proceedings before the Executive Office for \nImmigration Review, a DOJ agency. This final rule does not apply to \nthe public charge inadmissibility standards applied by DHS or DOJ. \nThis final rule will use the terms inadmissible to the United States \nand ineligible for a visa interchangeably.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. The Department's 2019 Interim Final Rule\n\n    On August 14, 2019, DHS issued a final rule amending standards in \nits regulations for determining inadmissibility under public charge \ngrounds. See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 FR 41292, as \namended on October 2, 2019, 84 FR 52357 (``2019 DHS Final Rule''). \nAmong other changes to these regulations, the 2019 DHS Final Rule \nexpanded DHS's definition of ``public charge'' and designated certain \nfactors or factual circumstances that could be weighted positively or \nnegatively, and some that would be ``heavily'' weighted, either \npositively or negatively, to consider whether an applicant was likely \nat any time to become a public charge.\n    On October 11, 2019, the Department issued the 2019 IFR, which \namended Department regulations at 22 CFR 40.41 to modify its standards \nfor when a consular officer would determine that a noncitizen is \nineligible for a visa under section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4), because they are likely at any time to become a public \ncharge.\\2\\ The Department issued the 2019 IFR largely to avoid \nsituations when a consular officer would evaluate an applicant's \ncircumstances and conclude that the applicant is not likely to become a \npublic charge, only for DHS to evaluate the same applicant when seeking \nadmission to the United States on a visa issued by the Department, and \nfind that the applicant is inadmissible on public charge grounds under \nthe same facts. Though the 2019 IFR included minor deviations from the \n2019 DHS Final Rule, its purpose was to align the Department's approach \nwith that of DHS's.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ 84 FR 54996 (Oct. 11, 2019).\n    \\3\\ See id. at 55002 (``The Department notes that this approach \ndeviates somewhat from the [2019 DHS Final Rule], in that the \nDepartment's approach focuses on the alien's intended household in \nthe United States, rather than any members of his foreign household \nhe or she will leave behind. This difference in effect aligns the \ntwo Departments' approaches.'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While the term ``public charge'' is not defined in the INA, the \ndefinition set forth in the 2019 IFR and the 2019 DHS Final Rule \ndiffered significantly from the definition applied for decades \npreviously, and most notably from the 1999 Field Guidance on \nDeportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds (``1999 \nInterim Field Guidance'') \\4\\ issued by the former Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and related FAM guidance issued by the \nDepartment, as further described below. Similar to the 2019 DHS Final \nRule, the 2019 IFR defined public charge to mean a noncitizen who \nreceives one or more public benefits, as defined in the 2019 IFR, for \nmore than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period. \nReceipt of two benefits in one month would count as two months' worth \nof benefits.\\5\\ Public benefits under the 2019 IFR included any \nFederal, State, local, or Tribal cash assistance for income maintenance \n(other than tax credits), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., the Housing Choice Voucher Program, as \nauthorized under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n(42 U.S.C. 1437f), Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate \nRehabilitation) authorized under section 8 of the United States Housing \nAct of 1937, Medicaid (with enumerated exclusions), and Public Housing \nunder section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g).\\6\\ \nFurther, the 2019 IFR included certain factors and factual \ncircumstances that weighed heavily in determining whether a visa \napplicant was likely to become a public charge, including negative and \npositive factors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Interim Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility \non Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689 (May 26, 1999).\n    \\5\\ 84 FR 54996, 55014.\n    \\6\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On July 29, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof New York granted a preliminary injunction against implementation of \nthe 2019 IFR, holding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in \ntheir claim that the 2019 IFR did not comply with the requirements of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act.\\7\\ The government filed a notice of \nappeal from this preliminary injunction, but the appeal was later \ndismissed at the government's request.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ Make the Road N.Y. v. Pompeo, 475 F. Supp. 3d 232, 262 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2020).\n    \\8\\ Make the Road N.Y. v. Pompeo, No. 20-3214 (S.D.N.Y. July 6, \n2021), ECF No. 118.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Following the preliminary injunction against enforcement of the \n2019 IFR, the Department issued FAM guidance to\n\n[[Page 60575]]\n\nconsular officers \\9\\ regarding compliance with the court order. The \nFAM guidance generally instructed consular officers adjudicating visas \nto apply the standards that had been in place prior to the 2019 IFR, \nstandards which were based on the 1999 Interim Field Guidance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See 9 FAM 302.8--PUBLIC CHARGE--INA 212(A)(4), <a href=\"https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html\">https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html</a> (last visited June 14, \n2023).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC. Purpose of Not Finalizing the Regulatory Standards in the 2019 IFR\n\n    There have been significant developments related to the public \ncharge ground of inadmissibility since the publication of the 2019 IFR. \nOn February 2, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14012, \nRestoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration System and Strengthening \nIntegration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans (``E.O. \n14012'').\\10\\ E.O. 14012 directed the Secretary, along with the \nAttorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other \nrelevant agency heads, to ''review all agency actions related to \nimplementation of the public charge ground of inadmissibility . . . and \nthe related ground of deportability.'' \\11\\ The President ordered each \nof the agencies to submit a report ``identify[ing] appropriate agency \nactions, if any, to address concerns about the current public charge \npolicies' effect on the integrity of the Nation's immigration system \nand public health'' and ``recommend[ing] steps that relevant agencies \nshould take to clearly communicate current public charge policies and \nproposed changes, if any, to reduce fear and confusion among impacted \ncommunities.'' \\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ Executive Order 14012, 86 FR 8277 (Feb. 5, 2021).\n    \\11\\ See Exec. Order No. 14012, sec. 4, 86 FR 8277, 8278 (Feb. \n5, 2021).\n    \\12\\ Id. Sec.  4(a).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On November 17, 2021, the Department published a notice in the \nFederal Register, 86 FR 64070 (``Public Comment Reopening''), \nsoliciting public comment on the 2019 IFR for an additional 60-day \nperiod, noting significant changes in circumstances since publication \nof the 2019 IFR.\\13\\ As described in the Public Comment Reopening, the \nchanges in intervening circumstances included public health and \neconomic conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic; a court's \nvacatur of the 2019 DHS Final Rule on a nationwide basis; and DHS's \npublication on August 23, 2021, of an Advance Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking, soliciting public feedback on the DHS interpretation of the \npublic charge ground of inadmissibility to inform a future rulemaking \non the issue. In light of those developments, in the Public Comment \nReopening, the Department specifically sought public feedback on \nwhether: (1) the 2019 IFR should be rescinded or revised; and (2) if \nso, what final rule should be adopted regarding visa ineligibility on \npublic charge grounds.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Visas: Ineligibility Based on Public Charge Grounds, 86 \nFR 64070 (Nov. 17, 2021).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As detailed below, following receipt of a range of public comments \nin response to the 2019 IFR and the 2021 Public Comment Reopening, the \nDepartment has decided not to finalize the regulatory amendments made \nby the 2019 IFR. Instead, the Department is removing from 22 CFR 40.41 \nthe regulations promulgated in the 2019 IFR and restoring the \nregulatory text as it appeared prior to the issuance of the 2019 IFR \n(``Prior Rule'').\\14\\ The Prior Rule was published in 1997, and, with \nnon-substantive changes,\\15\\ remained in place until the publication of \nthe 2019 IFR. The subsequently published 1999 Interim Field Guidance \nset forth a public charge rule substantially similar to the Prior Rule. \nThe majority of public comments opposed the 2019 IFR or recommended \nsubstantial revisions, noting an array of public harms that they \nattributed to the overall public charge policy reflected in the 2019 \nIFR, including a measurable decline in enrollment in assistance \nprograms by children in families with noncitizen members, far more than \nthe decline of enrollment in assistance programs by children in \nfamilies with no noncitizen members.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ Visas: Public Charge, 62 FR 67563 (Dec. 29, 1997).\n    \\15\\ See Immigrant Visas; Change in the Schedule of Fees for \nConsular Services, 65 FR 78094 (Dec. 14, 2000); Nomenclature Changes \nReflecting Creation of Department of Homeland Security, 71 FR 34519 \n(Jun. 15, 2006).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In 2022, DHS promulgated the 2022 DHS Final Rule in which it \nexplained why it believed its 2019 Final Rule did not represent the \nbest interpretation of the public charge statute.\\16\\ The 2022 DHS \nFinal Rule adopts a significantly different standard for determining \nwhether an individual is likely at any time to become a public charge \nthan the standard reflected in DHS's 2019 Final Rule and the \nDepartment's 2019 IFR. The 2022 DHS Final Rule promulgated a rule \ngoverning the public charge grounds of inadmissibility, which, while \nnot identical, is substantially similar to the 1999 Interim Field \nGuidance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ See Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility, 87 FR 55472 \n(Sept. 9, 2022).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Accordingly, the 2019 IFR no longer meets the policy aim of \nconsistency with DHS standards, which was the Department's principal \nreason for adopting the 2019 IFR. The Department therefore will not \nfinalize the provisions in the 2019 IFR, which have been subject to a \npreliminary injunction since July 2020, and will instead return to the \nPrior Rule pending further rulemaking. The standards contained in the \nPrior Rule, together with the associated FAM guidance, align better \nwith the 2022 DHS Final Rule than the 2019 IFR. After the instant rule \nis finalized, the Department anticipates that it will initiate new \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in light of the 2022 DHS Final Rule to \npursue any further amendments to the Department's regulatory text on \npublic charge ineligibility, as appropriate.\n\nD. Alternatives Considered\n\n    The Department considered alternatives to this final rule. For \nexample, the Department considered promulgating a final rule, following \nthe 2019 IFR, but taking into account comments received, that would \namend significantly the standards of the 2019 IFR to more closely align \nwith the 2022 DHS Final Rule. The Department declined to pursue this \nalternative, because, despite the two periods of public comment on the \n2019 IFR, it would not provide the public an opportunity to provide \ncomment on the new standards, in the context of the Department's \nrulemaking. For that reason, the Department believes it is appropriate \nnot to finalize the 2019 IFR with revised standards and instead to \nundertake new notice-and-comment rulemaking in light of the 2022 DHS \nFinal Rule.\n    The Department also considered publishing a proposed rule with new \nstandards for visa ineligibility based on the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility, without first removing changes to the regulations \npromulgated under the 2019 IFR. The Department determined that this \nalternative would not best achieve the Department's policy objective of \nconsistency in administration of the public charge grounds of \ninadmissibility with DHS, because amendments from the 2019 IFR would \nremain in Department regulations while the new standards underwent \npublic notice and comment. Because the 2019 IFR was principally \ndesigned to align with the standards of the 2019 DHS Final Rule, the \n2019 IFR, if applied now, would create a pronounced inconsistency with \nthe standards in the 2022 DHS Final Rule, and the Department determined \nthat\n\n[[Page 60576]]\n\nneither retaining nor finalizing the regulatory amendments made by the \n2019 IFR while it undertook further rulemaking was appropriate.\n    The Department also considered whether there might be policy \nalternatives to amending the 2019 IFR or removing changes to \nregulations from the 2019 IFR. The Department determined that there are \nno such viable alternatives because the standards promulgated under the \n2019 IFR are entirely inconsistent with the standards implemented by \nDHS in the 2022 DHS Final Rule with respect to inadmissibility under \nthe public charge grounds.\n\nE. Consideration of Reliance Interests\n\n    In preparing this final rule, the Department also considered \nwhether there were any serious reliance interests that would be harmed \nby removing the 2019 IFR and returning to the Prior Rule.\n    While no comments submitted in response to the 2019 IFR or Public \nComment Reopening directly or indirectly identified reliance interests \nof any individuals or public or private entities that have relied on \nthe policy articulated in the 2019 IFR, the Department's regulations, \nwhich can affect the interests of individuals and entities in the \nUnited States, could have potentially engendered degrees of reliance. \nThe 2019 IFR may have engendered such an interest, for example, by \nindividuals or public or private entities. For instance, public \nentities such as state or local governments may assert reliance on the \nenjoined rule given potential effects on noncitizens obtaining public \nbenefits in the United States. The Department has considered those \npotential interests and taken them into consideration in formulating \nthis final rule.\n    The Department concludes that the reasons not to finalize the \nregulatory amendments made by the 2019 IFR outweigh any such reliance \ninterests, which appear minimal, in light of a number of factors, \nincluding: (1) the limited period in which this policy was in effect \nprior to the preliminary injunction, as any reliance interests have \nbeen significantly reduced as compared to a longstanding rule or agency \npolicy; (2) the significant time during which the Department has been \nenjoined from implementing the policy; (3) the Department's notice to \nthe public in the Public Comment Reopening that it was considering \nremoving the regulations promulgated under the 2019 IFR, and \nsolicitation of public comments on whether to adopt, revise, or rescind \nit; (4) the explicitly ``interim'' nature of the 2019 IFR itself; and \n(5) the significant policy interests articulated in this rule that \nsupport removal of the regulations, specifically the interest in \nensuring that the Department and DHS do not apply significantly \ndifferent public charge standards to determine a given individual's \nvisa eligibility and eligibility for admission to the United States.\n    In reverting to the Prior Rule and in continuing to apply the FAM \nguidance, consular officers will continue to apply the Department's \npolicy of implementing the public charge ground of inadmissibility \nconsistently with current DHS standards and the Department's FAM \nguidance. As the nationwide preliminary injunction has been in place \nsince July 2020, the Department has in practice reverted to the Prior \nRule since that time. Compared with the standards set forth in the 2019 \nIFR, the Prior Rule more closely aligns with the standards articulated \nby DHS in the 2022 DHS Final Rule.\n\nF. Comments Received in Response to 2019 IFR and 2021 Public Comment \nReopening\n\n1. Summary of Comments\n    In the 2019 IFR, the Department solicited public comments on the \nrule for a 30-day period following publication on October 11, 2019. \nDuring that period, the Department received 199 comments from \nindividuals, local and state governments, public officials, and non-\ngovernmental organizations. The Department reviewed these comments, of \nwhich 4 expressed support for the 2019 IFR; 19 were non-responsive to \nthe 2019 IFR; and 34 did not clearly reflect support or opposition to \nthe 2019 IFR. The remaining 142 comments expressed opposition to the \n2019 IFR.\n    The Public Comment Reopening solicited public comments on the IFR \nfor an additional 60-day period following publication of the notice on \nNovember 17, 2021. In response, the Department received 32 comments \n\\17\\ from individuals, local and state governments, public officials, \nand non-governmental organizations. The Department reviewed these \ncomments, of which 3 expressed support for the 2019 IFR and 29 opposed \nthe 2019 IFR and suggested rescission or substantial revision of the \n2019 IFR on a variety of bases, discussed below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ There were 33 total comments submitted, but one was an \nidentical comment submitted by the same commenter. As the substance \nof the comments was identical, the Department considers both \ncomments as one comment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The below table provides a summary of the total comments received:\n\n                    Table 1--Total Comments Received\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSupport for the 2019 IFR...........................................    7\nOpposition to 2019 IFR.............................................  171\nNeither Clearly Supporting nor Opposing............................   34\nNonresponsive......................................................   19\n                                                                    ----\n    Total..........................................................  231\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The summary and discussion of comments below reflects the comments \nreceived in response to the 2019 IFR, including those received in \nresponse to the Public Comment Reopening. Of those comments expressing \nopposition to the 2019 IFR, the most common reasons expressed were \nopposition to policies first articulated in the 2019 DHS Final Rule; \nharmful effects of the overall public charge policy reflected in the \n2019 IFR on immigrant families; that the interpretation of the public \ncharge ground of inadmissibility in the 2019 IFR was unlawful; that the \n2019 DHS Final Rule was enjoined; and that the overall public charge \npolicy reflected in the 2019 IFR had a chilling effect that deterred \nfamilies from receiving public benefits to which they were eligible. As \ndetailed in Table 3, other comments in opposition to the 2019 IFR \nincluded objections to the rule's circumstantial eligibility factors \nand concerns that calculations related to the statutory factors were \narbitrary. Several commenters opined that the 2019 IFR was \ndiscriminatory against immigrants from particular regions or that it \nwould unduly burden the U.S. national economy. The two tables below \ndescribe the categories of comments submitted by the public both in \nfavor of and in opposition to the 2019 IFR, noting that some comments \nexpressed more than one basis for support or opposition to the rule.\n\n          Table 2--Comments in Support of 2019 IFR, by Category\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReduce Overall Immigration.........................................    3\nImmigrants Should be Self-Sufficient...............................    2\nImmigrants Should Not Go on Welfare................................    1\nImmigrant Communities are Already Self-Sufficient..................    1\n                                                                    ----\n    Total..........................................................    7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n      Table 3--Comments in Opposition to 2019 IFR, by Category \\18\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOppose 2019 DHS Public Charge Rule.................................  105\nIFR is Unlawful....................................................   80\n2019 Harmful to Immigrant Families.................................   86\nDHS Rule and IFR were under Injunction.............................   65\n\n[[Page 60577]]\n\n \nChilling Effect to Deter Receipt of Public Benefits................   65\nIFR is Discriminatory or Racist....................................   41\nOppose Circumstantial Eligibility Factors..........................   39\nEconomically Burdensome on Families................................   39\nUnfair Calculations under IFR......................................   34\nOppose Definition of Public Charge in IFR..........................   31\nPrivate Health Insurance Concern...................................   19\nOther..............................................................   40\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Comments Expressing Support for Finalizing the 2019 IFR\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ Several commenters expressed multiple reasons for \nopposition; each reason listed in this table shows the primary \nreasons for opposition to the IFR. Additionally, there may be some \noverlap between arguments raised by some commenters.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Comment: Three commenters expressed support for the 2019 IFR, \nbecause, in the commenters' opinion, levels of immigration to the \nUnited States are too high and finalizing the 2019 IFR would have the \neffect of restricting or lowering immigration levels overall.\n    Response: The INA governs the standards regarding a noncitizen's \nadmissibility to the United States, and the Department seeks to \nfaithfully implement the statutory public charge ground of \ninadmissibility. The Department will continue to apply the public \ncharge ground of inadmissibility to nonimmigrant and immigrant visa \napplicants in classifications that are subject to this ground, noting \nthat, by statute, the ground does not apply to certain nonimmigrant \nvisa classifications.\\19\\ The INA sets out worldwide levels of \nimmigration for each fiscal year for certain family-sponsored, \nemployment-based, and diversity immigrants, while excluding certain \nimmigrants (notably the immediately relatives of U.S. citizens) from \nnumerical limitations. Most nonimmigrant visa classifications are not \nsubject to numerical limitations. Between FY 2016 and 2019, DOS issued \napproximately 543,000 immigrant visas and 9,458,000 nonimmigrant visas \nannually (on average). Considering the overall demand for visas and \npre-pandemic trends in visa issuance, the Department does not expect \nthat the 2019 IFR or this final rule would change the overall level of \nimmigration.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ Several classifications of nonimmigrant and immigrant visa \napplicants are expressly exempted from the public charge grounds of \nvisa ineligibility. Such visa classifications include, without \nlimitation, Special Immigrant Visa applicants who were Afghan or \nIraqi nationals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. Government, and \napplicants for A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3, G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, NATO-1, NATO-\n2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-6, T, and U (with a limited exception) \nnonimmigrant visas. Applicants for S nonimmigrant visas may also \nobtain a waiver of the public charge grounds of visa ineligibility. \nA full list of exemptions and waivers from the public charge grounds \nof inadmissibility is contained in the 2022 DHS Final Rule, 87 FR \n55472, 55637-39 (Sept. 9, 2022).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    This conclusion is supported by the immigrant and nonimmigrant visa \nstatistics available for fiscal year 2020, which covers the time period \nwhen the 2019 IFR was in effect.\\20\\ In fiscal year 2020, consular \nofficers made 6,541 inadmissibility findings based on public charge \ngrounds when adjudicating immigrant visas, and 6,175 were overcome. For \nnonimmigrants, the Department made 343 inadmissibility findings based \non public charge grounds, and 193 were overcome. When compared to the \noverall volume of immigrant and nonimmigrant visa issuances, the number \nof noncitizens found inadmissible who did not overcome that finding \nwhile the 2019 IFR was in effect was negligible. Consequently, the \nDepartment does not believe that reversion to the prior regulatory text \nwill affect worldwide levels of immigration.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ Department of State, Annual Report of the Visa Office 2020, \nTable XIX, <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2020AnnualReport/FY20AnnualReport-Table%20XIX.pdf\">https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2020AnnualReport/FY20AnnualReport-Table%20XIX.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Comment: Two commenters expressed support for the 2019 IFR, stating \nthat immigrants should be self-sufficient, and that visas should not be \nissued to individuals who will not be able to support themselves.\n    Response: Even after the publication of this final rule, consular \nofficers will continue to apply the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility to applicants for nonimmigrant and immigrant visas in \nclassifications that are subject to this ground of inadmissibility. A \nconsular officer who finds that an applicant for a visa is likely at \nany time to become a public charge is required to refuse the \napplicant's application on that basis.\\21\\ However, this refusal may be \novercome by presenting additional evidence to the consular officer that \nthe inadmissibility no longer applies, or by posting a ``suitable and \nproper bond or undertaking.'' \\22\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See 9 FAM 302.8--PUBLIC CHARGE--INA 212(A)(4), <a href=\"https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html\">https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html</a> (last visited June 14, \n2023).\n    \\22\\ 8 U.S.C. 1183.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Additionally, federal law generally prevents noncitizens who are \nsubject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility from taking \nadvantage of means-tested benefits programs by generally excluding them \nfrom participation for the five years after admission to the United \nStates or adjustment of status.\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ Public Law 104-193 tit. IV, 8 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Consular officers shall apply the grounds in accordance with the \nregulatory text that was in place prior to the publication of the 2019 \nIFR. Additionally, they will be advised to continue applying FAM \nguidance that implements the public charge ground of inadmissibility, \nwhich generally is aligned with the current DHS standards. After the \ninstant Final Rule takes effect, the Department anticipates that it \nwill undertake new notice-and-comment rulemaking in light of the 2022 \nDHS Final Rule.\n    Comment: One commenter expressed support for the 2019 IFR, stating \nthat visa applicants should be vetted to ensure they will not overstay \ntheir visas, have children in the United States, and then apply for \nwelfare.\n    Response: All visa applicants undergo a thorough screening and \nvetting process, and must establish to the satisfaction of the consular \nofficer that they are eligible to receive a visa in accordance with \nU.S. law. Just as the Department will continue to faithfully administer \nthe public charge ground of inadmissibility, it will also continue to \nadminister the other wide-ranging grounds of inadmissibility in section \n212(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), that apply to nonimmigrant and \nimmigrant visa applicants. However, whether an applicant is likely to \noverstay their visa within the United States or have children is \noutside the scope of a review of an applicant's admissibility on public \ncharge grounds.\n    Comment: One commenter expressed support for the 2019 IFR because, \nin the commenter's view, it would reduce levels of unauthorized \npresence of noncitizens in the United States. The commenter expressed \ntheir belief that many immigrants in the United States ``refuse to \nassimilate.''\n    Response: Levels of unauthorized presence and ``assimilation'' are \noutside the scope of this rule. Consular officers apply the public \ncharge ground of visa ineligibility with respect to visa applicants, \nand specifically those who are likely to become a public charge. This \nrule and policy have no direct bearing on whether noncitizens remain in \nlawful status in the United States.\n    Comment: One commenter expressed support for the 2019 IFR, stating \nthat according to some statistics, immigrants to the United States are \nmore highly educated and seek public benefits less often than citizens \nborn in the United States. For that reason, the commenter stated that \nfinalizing the 2019 IFR would not harm immigrant communities.\n    Response: The Department's policy goal of consistency with DHS \nstandards\n\n[[Page 60578]]\n\nin applying the public charge ground of inadmissibility weighs against \nfinalizing on a permanent basis amendments to regulations that were \nimplemented as a result of the 2019 IFR.\n3. Comments in Opposition to 2019 IFR\n(a) Oppose 2019 DHS Final Rule\n    Comment: 105 commenters expressed opposition to the Department's \n2019 IFR citing their opposition to the 2019 DHS Final Rule. The stated \nreasons for opposing the 2019 DHS Final Rule were varied and included \nmany of the other reasons listed in Table 3 above.\n    Response: The Department acknowledges the opposition expressed \ntowards the 2019 DHS Final Rule. The Department issued the 2019 IFR in \npart to avoid situations when a consular officer would evaluate an \napplicant's circumstances and conclude that the applicant is not likely \nto become a public charge, only for DHS to reach a different conclusion \nunder the 2019 DHS Final Rule when the applicant sought admission to \nthe United States. In light of DHS's removal of the regulatory text \npromulgated in the 2019 DHS Final Rule, as well as DHS's subsequent \nissuance of the 2022 DHS Final Rule in which DHS explained its decision \nto not again pursue the policies contained in the 2019 DHS Final \nRule,\\24\\ the Department's policy interest in ensuring that noncitizen \ntravelers to the United States in similarly situated circumstances are \nsubject to fair and consistent adjudications under U.S. law when \napplying for a visa and when seeking admission to the United States on \nthat visa is not advanced by finalizing the regulatory amendments made \nby the 2019 IFR. Rather, reverting to the Prior Rule will better ensure \nthat the Department maintains consistency with the 2022 DHS Final Rule \nbecause the Prior Rule aligns with the standards contemplated by the \n1999 Interim Field Guidance, which influenced the policy reflected in \nthe 2022 DHS Final Rule. Additionally, following reversion to the Prior \nRule, consular officers will apply the FAM guidance currently in place, \nwhich generally is aligned with the current DHS standards, and avoids \ntreating visa applicants differently from similarly situated \napplications for admission or adjustment of status under the 2022 DHS \nFinal Rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See, e.g., 87 FR 55472, 55504 (Sept. 9, 2022).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(b) 2019 IFR Is Unlawful\n    Comment: Many commenters suggested that the 2019 IFR should be \nrescinded because it was contrary to the statute and was unlawful. Many \ncommenters had submitted their comments stating that the 2019 IFR was \nunlawful before it was preliminarily enjoined by a federal district \ncourt, but after the 2019 DHS Final Rule had been found unlawful and \npreliminarily enjoined or vacated by federal courts. Some commenters in \n2019 noted that federal district courts had issued injunctions against \nthe 2019 DHS Final Rule. Some commenters in response to the Public \nComment Reopening noted that on March 9, 2021, a federal district court \norder vacating the 2019 DHS Final Rule went into effect.\n    Response: The judicial decision regarding the 2019 IFR that \nenjoined its application, and the judicial decisions enjoining or \nvacating the 2019 DHS Final Rule were considered in the Department's \ndecision to reopen the public comment period on the 2019 IFR.\\25\\ In \nthe 2019 IFR, the Department noted that, as a policy matter, \ncoordination of the Department's and DHS's implementation of the public \ncharge inadmissibility ground is critical to the Department's interest \nin preventing inconsistent adjudication standards and different \noutcomes between determinations of visa eligibility and determinations \nof admissibility at or between a port of entry or in an application for \nadjustment of status.\\26\\ Given DHS's adoption of the 2022 DHS Final \nRule, the Department's interest in coordinating adjudication standards \nno longer favors retention of the regulatory amendments made by the \n2019 IFR and instead favors a return to the Prior Rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ See 86 FR 64070.\n    \\26\\ See 84 FR 54996.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(c) 2019 IFR Is Harmful to Immigrant Families\n    Comment: Some commenters expressed opposition to the overall public \ncharge policy reflected in the 2019 IFR because of what they alleged to \nbe its detrimental public health effect on immigrant families.\n    Response: The Department understands these commenters' concerns \nabout the relationship between public charge inadmissibility \ndeterminations under the standards set forth in the 2019 DHS Final Rule \nand the 2019 IFR and the willingness of immigrant families, including \nU.S. citizen children in immigrant families, to receive public benefits \nfor which they were eligible. Following the reversion of regulations to \nthose in place prior to the 2019 IFR, the public charge grounds of visa \nineligibility have been and will be applied in a way that should \nameliorate the concern of these commenters. This final rule will be \naccompanied by public outreach by the Department to ensure that \nimmigrant communities understand this rule, including how it differs \nfrom the 2019 IFR.\n(d) 2019 DHS Final Rule and 2019 IFR Were Enjoined\n    Comment: A large number of commenters argued that the 2019 IFR \nshould be rescinded because the 2019 DHS Final Rule, which was \nconsistent in substance with the 2019 IFR, was vacated by a federal \ndistrict court, and preliminarily enjoined by that court and multiple \nother federal district courts. In response to the Public Charge \nReopening, several commenters also noted that the 2019 IFR itself was \npreliminarily enjoined by a federal district court.\n    Response: As stated above, the judicial orders enjoining or \nvacating the 2019 DHS Final Rule were considered in the Department's \ndecision to reopen the public comment period on the 2019 IFR.\\27\\ For \nthe reasons stated above, the Department is not finalizing that \nregulatory text, and is instead reverting to the Prior Rule and \ncontinuing to apply current FAM guidance,\\28\\ while considering new \nrulemaking in light of the 2022 DHS Final Rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ See 86 FR 64070.\n    \\28\\ See 9 FAM 302.8--PUBLIC CHARGE--INA 212(A)(4), <a href=\"https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html\">https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html</a> (last visited June 14, \n2023).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(e) 2019 IFR Is Discriminatory or Racially Biased\n    Comment: 41 comments stated that the 2019 IFR was either racially \nbiased or discriminatory in how it applied the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility. Commenters claimed that the 2019 IFR rendered certain \nvisa applicants inadmissible on public charge grounds due to conditions \nin their countries of origin.\n    Response: The 2019 IFR explained the Department's reasons for \nadopting the IFR, in particular as a means to ensure consistency with \nthe 2019 DHS Final Rule. As noted, the Department will not finalize the \nregulatory amendments made by the 2019 IFR for the reasons stated \npreviously and anticipates that it will undertake further rulemaking in \nlight of the 2022 DHS Final Rule. In the development of any future \nrulemaking regarding the public charge ground of inadmissibility, the \nDepartment will continue to be faithful to the relevant statute and \ncongressional directions, including developing a rule that can be \napplied fairly and consistently to applicants worldwide in a manner \nconsistent with the laws and values of the United States.\n\n[[Page 60579]]\n\n(f) Opposition to Circumstantial Eligibility Factors in 2019 IFR\n    Comment: 39 commenters expressed opposition to the 2019 IFR due to \nwhat were described as circumstantial eligibility factors to be \nconsidered in the totality of the circumstances analysis. The 2019 IFR \nlisted a number of factors that an adjudicator would consider in the \ntotality of the circumstances when determining whether a visa applicant \nis inadmissible on public charge grounds and listed a number of \ndifferent benefits the receipt of which over a certain period of time \ncould lead to a finding of inadmissibility. Some commenters argued that \nthese factors were designed to increase the percentage of applicants \nwho would be found inadmissible. Others argued that the factors were so \ncomplicated that public benefit administrators had difficulty advising \npotential recipients on a course of action they could take that would \nbe consistent with the public charge policy set forth in the 2019 IFR.\n    Response: The Department's consular officers will continue to apply \na totality of the circumstances framework for the analysis of the \npublic charge ground of inadmissibility consistent with the statute, \nthe Prior Rule, and guidance published in the FAM. Under the FAM \nguidance, in making public charge inadmissibility determinations, \nconsular officers will look at ``many factors . . . including age, \nhealth, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education, \nand skills. No single factor, other than the lack of a qualifying \naffidavit of support, in accordance with INA 213A, if required, will \ndetermine whether an individual is a public charge.'' \\29\\ Under this \nFAM guidance, these factors make up the ``totality of the \ncircumstances'' framework that was in place prior to the publication of \nthe 2019 IFR. This framework aligns more closely with the current DHS \nstandards than the 2019 IFR.\\30\\ The FAM guidance clearly notes for \nadjudicators and the public that the application of the public charge \nground of inadmissibility differs significantly from the heavily \nweighted positive and negative factors set forth in the 2019 IFR. The \nFAM guidance is also consistent with the Prior Rule, which along with \nthe statute will govern adjudications.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See 9 FAM 302.8-2(B)(1)--Definition of Public Charge \n<a href=\"https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html\">https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html</a> (last visited June \n14, 2023).\n    \\30\\ 9 FAM 302.8-2(B)(2)--Public Charge--Applying INA 212(a)(4) \nto Immigrants, <a href=\"https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html\">https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html</a> \n(last visited June 14, 2023).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(g) 2019 IFR Is Economically Burdensome on Families\n    Comment: 39 commenters stated that the overall public charge policy \nreflected in the 2019 IFR imposed economic burdens on immigrant \nfamilies and other vulnerable populations within the United States, \nincreasing healthcare costs on an aggregate basis and increasing food \ninsecurity.\n    Response: Neither the 2019 IFR nor this final rule address \neligibility standards for the receipt of public benefits. However, the \nDepartment acknowledges the data provided by public commenters showing \na measurable drop in receipt of public benefits by individuals who were \neligible to receive such benefits during the time period after the \npublication of the 2019 DHS Final Rule and the 2019 IFR.\\31\\ Following \nthe effective date of this Final Rule, the public charge \ninadmissibility ground will be applied as interpreted by the Prior Rule \nand FAM guidance, which generally are aligned more closely with the \ncurrent DHS standards than the 2019 IFR. Reverting to the Prior Rule \nwill reduce any unintended economic burdens among immigrant populations \nnot subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility, while not \nimposing undue burdens on the public.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ New American Economy, The New ``Public Charge Rule and its \nNegative Impact on the U.S. Economy, Feb. 2, 2021, <a href=\"https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/economic-impact-of-public-charge-rule/\">https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/economic-impact-of-public-charge-rule/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(h) Methods of Calculation in 2019 IFR Are Unfairly Derived\n    Comment: Distinct from the opposition to the ``totality of the \ncircumstances'' framework set forth in the 2019 IFR, a number of \ncommenters argued that its methods of calculation of factors in public \ncharge inadmissibility determinations, both positively and negatively \nweighted, with certain factors being heavily weighted in either \ndirection, were themselves unfairly derived and applied. Specifically, \ncommenters argued that the way in which factors were heavily weighted, \neither positively or negatively, would result in inconsistent \nadjudicatory results in applying the public charge grounds of \ninadmissibility.\n    Response: Under section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), \nconsular officers are required to consider specific factors, at a \nminimum, in determining whether an applicant for a nonimmigrant or \nimmigrant visa is inadmissible because they are likely at any time to \nbecome a public charge. These factors are the applicant's age; health; \nfamily status; assets, resources, and financial status; and education \nand skills. Furthermore, a consular officer may also consider an \nAffidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA submitted on the \nnoncitizen's behalf when such is required.\\32\\ The 2019 IFR sought to \nensure the Department was consistent with the policy set forth in the \n2019 DHS Final Rule in how the Department considered such factors when \napplying the public charge ground. DHS promulgated a new rule in 2022 \nthat departs from the 2019 DHS Final Rule and the 2019 IFR's approach \nto consideration of such factors. Accordingly, as explained, the \nDepartment will not finalize the regulatory amendments made by the 2019 \nIFR, including its approach to consideration of such factors, because \ndoing so would create rather than avoid inconsistency with DHS. The \nDepartment is also inclined to agree with DHS's analysis regarding the \nissues posed by the weighing of factors in the 2019 DHS Final Rule. The \nDepartment anticipates that it will engage in further rulemaking in \nlight of DHS's 2022 rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ See INA sec. 212(a)(4)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As the Department is not finalizing the regulatory amendments made \nby the 2019 IFR, the inadmissibility of applicants for nonimmigrant and \nimmigrant visas subject to the public charge ground shall be reviewed \non the basis of the totality of their circumstances, consistent with \nDepartment regulations and guidance in place prior to the promulgation \nof the 2019 IFR.\n(i) Breadth of Definition of ``Public Charge'' in 2019 IFR\n    Comment: 31 commenters opposed the definition of ``public charge'' \nset forth in the 2019 IFR. Commenters stated that the definition was \ntoo broad; asserted that it was inconsistent with congressional intent, \nhistorical practice, judicial decisions, and administrative guidance; \nand raised other objections to the definition listed therein.\n    Response: While the term ``public charge'' is not defined in the \ntext of the INA and the statute vests the Department with discretion in \nits administration, the Department acknowledges that the definition set \nforth in the 2019 IFR and the 2019 DHS Final Rule differed \nsignificantly from the definition applied for decades previously, most \nnotably in the 1999 Interim Field Guidance and related FAM guidance \nissued by the Department. The 2019 IFR had\n\n[[Page 60580]]\n\nimplemented this definition out of a desire to more closely align with \nthe standards then applied by DHS in determining inadmissibility on \npublic charge grounds. In 2022, DHS published a new Final Rule, \nimplementing different standards. In the 2022 DHS Final Rule, DHS \ndiscussed in depth the definition that it used in the 2019 DHS Final \nRule, and how it will not be applied in implementing the 2022 DHS Final \nRule. As such, the 2019 IFR no longer meets the policy aim of \nconsistency with DHS standards. The Department will instead restore the \nPrior Rule, and after the instant rule is finalized, anticipates that \nit will initiate new rulemaking in light of the 2022 DHS Final Rule.\n(j) Private Health Insurance Concerns\n    Comment: Some commenters, particularly those focused on healthcare, \nasserted that the overall public charge policy reflected in the 2019 \nIFR had an adverse effect on the private health insurance industry. In \nparticular, commenters stated that the increased numbers of immigrants \nnot accepting public health benefits to which they would normally be \neligible caused overall healthcare costs to increase, leading to an \naggregate increase in private health insurance premiums for the public.\n    Response: The Department appreciates these commenters' concerns \nabout the relationship between public charge inadmissibility \ndeterminations and private health insurance. We acknowledge evidence \nprovided by many commenters suggesting that perceptions about the \noverall public charge policy reflected in the 2019 IFR had unintended \neffects on the willingness of individuals outside the scope of the IFR, \nsuch as U.S. citizens with noncitizen family members, to enroll in \nhealth insurance programs for which they are eligible.\\33\\ The \nreversion to the Prior Rule will provide applicants with a clearer \nunderstanding of the application of the public charge grounds of \ninadmissibility, which should mitigate unintended consequences such as \ndisenrollment in health insurance programs by U.S. citizens with non-\ncitizen family members.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ Department of Health and Human Services, ``Health Insurance \nCoverage and Access to Care for Immigrants: Key Challenges and \nPolicy Options'' (Dec. 17, 2021), <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/96cf770b168dfd45784cdcefd533d53e/immigrant-health-equity-brief.pdf\">https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/96cf770b168dfd45784cdcefd533d53e/immigrant-health-equity-brief.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(k) Inconsistent With Executive Order 14012\n    Comment: Three commenters suggested that the 2019 IFR should be \nrescinded because it contradicts E.O. 14012,\\34\\ which called on \ngovernment departments and agencies to review public charge policies \nand other current immigration policies, in order to consider their \neffect on the integrity of the national immigration system. E.O. 14012 \nalso called upon government departments to consider better methods of \ncommunicating its public charge policies and proposed changes, if any, \nwith the public.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\34\\ Executive Order 14012, 86 FR 8277 (Feb. 5, 2021).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Response: Through the instant rulemaking, the Department is \ndeclining to make permanent the regulatory amendments made by the 2019 \nIFR. The Department anticipates that it will engage in rulemaking in \nlight of the 2022 DHS Final Rule, pursuant to the Executive Branch's \npolicy as articulated in section 1 of E.O. 14012. Until a subsequent \nrule is developed and published, the Department will continue to \ninstruct its consular officers to apply the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility consistent with the statute, Prior Rule, and guidance \ncontained in the FAM.\\35\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\35\\ See 9 FAM 302.8--PUBLIC CHARGE--INA 212(A)(4), <a href=\"https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html\">https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM030208.html</a> (last visited June 14, \n2023).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(l) Excessive Burden on State, Local, and Territorial Governments\n    Comment: Some localities and states submitted comments, arguing \nthat the overall public charge policy reflected in the 2019 IFR \nconstituted a burden on state, local and territorial governments' \nability to administer their own public health services and other \nbenefits.\n    Response: The Department acknowledges the uncertainty many state, \nlocal, Tribal, and territorial governments experienced due to the \nadministrative changes caused by the overall public charge policy \nreflected in the 2019 IFR. According to a joint public comment by \nattorneys general from twenty states and the District of Columbia, \nimmigrant parents of school aged children, whether citizens, LPRs, or \nnoncitizens, were hesitant to participate in distance learning, accept \nloaned technology, or participate in food distribution programs such as \nthe National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and the \nSummer Food Service Meal Program provided by state and local \ngovernments due to confusion regarding the overall public charge \npolicy. Other public commenters have expressed concern that the 2019 \nIFR dissuaded individuals in several communities, such as U.S. citizen \nfamily members of noncitizens overseas applying for visas, from \napplying for, collecting or retaining public benefits for which they \nwould have been eligible. And some commenters representing local and \nstate governments stated that they found a decline in enrollment in \npublic benefit programs relating to the overall change in public charge \npolicy, which resulted in unexpected changes to program usage. \nFollowing the reversion of regulations to those in place prior to the \n2019 IFR, the public charge ground of visa ineligibility has been and \nwill be applied in a way that should ameliorate the concern of these \ncommenters. This final rule will be accompanied by public outreach by \nthe Department and other stakeholders to ensure that immigrant \ncommunities understand this rule, including how it differs from the \n2019 IFR.\n\nG. Contents of This Final Rule\n\n    In continuing to apply the interpretation of the public charge \nground of inadmissibility that existed prior to the 2019 IFR, this \nfinal rule removes the amendments to the regulation made by the 2019 \nIFR and restores the regulatory text of the Prior Rule. The Department \nfinds, following its review of the public comments and the changes in \ncircumstances following publication of the 2019 IFR, that the \nDepartment's policy of ensuring consistency with DHS no longer supports \nthe 2019 IFR and that the Department should conduct further notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking in light of the 2022 DHS Final Rule.\n    The Public Comment Reopening solicited comments on (1) whether the \n2019 IFR should be rescinded or revised, and (2) what final rule should \nbe adopted, if any. In reviewing the public comments submitted in \nresponse to it, along with public comments provided in response to the \n2019 IFR, together with E.O. 14012 and the standards set forth in the \n2022 DHS Final Rule, the Department has concluded that reverting to the \nPrior Rule is the most appropriate path forward.\n    The Department is therefore not finalizing the regulatory \namendments made by the 2019 IFR and is instead reverting to the Prior \nRule. This does not represent any change from the policies the \nDepartment has applied since 2020, when the preliminary injunction of \nthe 2019 IFR took effect. This final rule restores the Prior Rule, with \nthe exception of a technical change\n\n[[Page 60581]]\n\nmade to remove an outdated reference to a particular portion of the \nSchedule of Fees for Consular Services.\\36\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ The Department also notes that the 2019 IFR found that the \ndescription of a procedure relating to the posting of a bond or \nundertaking was obsolete. See 84 FR 54996, 55010. While some of the \nspecific steps to posting a bond, as described in 22 CFR 40.41(d), \nhave changed since the original publication of the Prior Rule, the \nposting of a bond by a visa applicant is still authorized by \nsections 213 and 221(g) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1183, 1201. Revisions \nto this rule to update the bond procedure and other provisions would \nbe considered in the development of any future rule governing the \npublic charge ground of inadmissibility but are not addressed by \nthis final rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The interpretation of the public charge ground of inadmissibility \nin the Prior Rule more closely aligns with the standards articulated in \nthe 2022 DHS Final Rule. There is a significant policy interest in \nensuring that similarly situated noncitizen travelers to the United \nStates are subject to fair and consistent adjudications under U.S. law \nwhen applying for a visa and when seeking admission to the United \nStates on that visa. While the Prior Rule differs in some respects from \nthe 2022 DHS Final Rule (for example, while the 2022 DHS Final Rule \namends an existing information collection, the Department is not \nimplementing any changes to its information collections in reverting to \nthe Prior Rule), the change will greatly decrease the potential for \nunequal treatment and undue barriers for noncitizens applying for \nvisas.\n    Following publication of this final rule, the Department intends to \ncommence new rulemaking, which will have the goal of publishing and \nimplementing a more comprehensive public charge regulation. For the \nreasons discussed in this rule, the Department has removed the \nregulations promulgated under the 2019 IFR and reverted to the prior \ntext of 22 CFR 40.41.\n\nII. Regulatory Findings\n\nA. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1532 (``UMRA''), \ngenerally requires agencies to prepare a statement before proposing any \nrule that may result in an annual expenditure of $100 million or more \n(adjusted for inflation) by State, local, territorial, or Tribal \ngovernments, or by the private sector. This rule will generally \ncontinue consular practices that had been in place prior to 2019, and \nthat have been applied since the 2019 IFR was preliminarily enjoined by \na District Court in 2020. This rule does not require the Department to \nprepare a statement because it is not anticipated that it will result \nin an annual expenditure of $100 million or more (adjusted for \ninflation) by State, local, territorial, or Tribal governments, or by \nthe private sector.\\37\\ Additionally, this rule does not contain any \nFederal mandate (as defined in UMRA) because it does not impose any \nenforceable duty upon any level of government or private sector entity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\37\\ 2 U.S.C. 1532(a).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Executive Order 12866--Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    The Department has reviewed this rule to ensure its consistency \nwith the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in Executive \nOrder 12866. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined \nthat this is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order \n12866. As such, OMB has reviewed this regulation accordingly.\n    In comparison to the 2019 IFR, which was previously published and \nput into effect, this rule may result in new costs, benefits, and \ntransfers. The Department does not believe there are any quantifiable \nnew direct costs for this final rule, as the Department is not \nproposing to add additional information collection burdens on visa \napplicants. As such, visa applicants will see no increase in the time \nit takes to complete either the immigrant visa application or the \nnonimmigrant visa application or associated opportunity costs.\n    The Department believes that this final rule may have indirect \neffects on State, local, territorial, and/or Tribal governments, \nprimarily in the form of increased transfer payments from federal, \nstate, territorial and Tribal governments to individuals. According to \nOMB Circular A-4, transfer payments are payments of money from one \ngroup to another for which no goods or services are exchanged, and do \nnot affect the total resources available to society.\\38\\ Changes in \ntransfer payments are considered neither costs nor benefits of a rule. \nWhile acknowledging the potential chilling effects caused by the 2019 \nIFR, the Department emphasizes that neither the public charge statute \nnor this final rule directly regulates eligibility for public benefits \nfor any population. While the removal of the 2019 IFR from the \nregulations may result in increased transfer payments, the Department \nis unable to concretely quantify these effects. This final rule is \nbeing published after DHS published the 2022 DHS Final Rule, which may \nhave a more significant impact on the willingness of noncitizens to \naccept transfer payments than the removal of the 2019 IFR.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\38\\ See OMB, ``Circular A-4'' (Sept. 17, 2003), <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/circulars/A4/a-4.pdf\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/circulars/A4/a-4.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, the 2019 IFR was only in effect between October 15, 2019, \nwhen it was published in the Federal Register,\\39\\ and July 29, 2020, \nwhen the United States District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Department from its \napplication.\\40\\ In addition, on March 20, 2020, in response to the \nworldwide COVID-19 pandemic the Department temporarily suspended \nroutine visa services at all U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\\41\\ A \nphased resumption of services began on July 15, 2020, just two weeks \nbefore the preliminary injunction was issued.\\42\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\39\\ 84 FR 54996 (Oct. 11, 2019).\n    \\40\\ See Make the Road N.Y v. Pompeo, 475 F.Supp. 3d 232 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2020).\n    \\41\\ Department of State, Suspension of Routine Visa Services \n(Mar. 20, 2020), <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/suspension-of-routine-visa-services.html\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/suspension-of-routine-visa-services.html</a>.\n    \\42\\ Department of State, Phased Resumption of Visa Services, \n(July 15, 2020), <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/visa-services-operating-status-update.html\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/visa-services-operating-status-update.html</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Consistent with E.O. 12866, the Department considered the costs and \nbenefits of available regulatory alternatives. One alternative that the \nDepartment considered was finalizing the regulatory amendments made by \nthe 2019 IFR. However, as noted above, the Department adopted the 2019 \nIFR largely to conform with the 2019 DHS Final Rule, which has been \nsupplanted by the 2022 DHS Final Rule. In publishing this final rule, \nthe public charge grounds of inadmissibility will be applied using the \nPrior Rule and FAM Guidance, as they were applied prior to 2019. The \nDepartment believes that, to the extent practicable, standards for the \nenforcement of the public charge ground of inadmissibility should be \nconsistent in order to ensure consistent application among similarly \nsituated noncitizens. As such, the Department does not believe that \nfinalizing the regulatory amendments made by the 2019 IFR would be the \nbest course of action.\n\nC. Executive Orders 13563 and 14094--Improving and Modernizing \nRegulation and Regulatory Review\n\n    Along with Executive Order 12866, Executive Order 13563 directs \nagencies to assess costs and benefits of available regulatory \nalternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory \napproaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, \nenvironmental, public health and safety effects, distributed impacts, \nand equity).\n\n[[Page 60582]]\n\nThe Department has reviewed the final rule under Executive Order 13563 \nand has determined that this rulemaking is consistent with the \nprinciples therein.\n    Additionally, the Department has reviewed this rule to ensure its \nconsistency with the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in \nExecutive Order 14094 and confirms this rulemaking is consistent with \nthe principles therein.\n\nD. Executive Orders 12372 and 13132--Federalism\n\n    This final rule will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the National Government and the \nStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Nor will the final rule have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nE. Executive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \nTribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian Tribal governments, and will not preempt Tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nF. Executive Order 12988--Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed the rule considering sections 3(a) and \n3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, minimize \nlitigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce burden.\n\nG. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This final rule does not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-\n3520. The 2019 IFR imposed a new information collection requirement. \nOMB subsequently granted an emergency approval for the use of a new \nform by the Department, DS-5540, Public Charge Questionnaire (``DS-\n5540'').\\43\\ The emergency approval was granted only until August 31, \n2020, and expired after that date. OMB has not approved the information \ncollection under the DS-5540 since that time, and on March 26, 2021, \nthe Department published a notice stating that visa applicants are not \nrequired to complete and should not present a DS-5540.\\44\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\43\\ Notice of OMB Emergency Approval of Information Collection: \nPublic Charge Questionnaire, 85 FR 13694 (Mar. 9, 2020).\n    \\44\\ Update on Public Charge, <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/update-on-public-charge.html\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/update-on-public-charge.html</a> (Mar. 26, \n2021).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nH. Regulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Businesses\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires \nagencies to perform an analysis of the potential impact of regulations \non small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small \norganizations during the development of their rules. ``Small entities'' \ncomprises small business, not-for-profit organizations that are \nindependently owned and operated and not dominant within their fields, \nor governmental jurisdictions with populations under 50,000. This final \nrule would not regulate ``small entities'' as that term is defined in 5 \nU.S.C. 601(6) and as such does not have a significant economic impact \non a substantial number of small entities. This final rule only applies \nto individual visa applicants, which are not defined as a ``small \nentity'' by the RFA.\n\nI. Congressional Review Act\n\n    The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined \nthat this final rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined by Subtitle E \nof the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, also \nknown as the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 804(2). This final rule \nwill not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or \nmore; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse \neffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, \ninnovation, or on the ability of United States-based companies to \ncompete with foreign-based companies in domestic and import markets. \nThe Department will send this final rule to Congress and to the \nComptroller General pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. \n801.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 40\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Foreign relations, \nPassports and visas.\n\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department amends 22 \nCFR part 40 as follows:\n\nPART 40--REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO BOTH NONIMMIGRANTS AND \nIMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 40 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  8 U.S.C. 1104, 1182, 1183a, 1641.\n\n\n0\n2. Section 40.41 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  40.41  Public charge.\n\n    (a) Basis for determination of ineligibility. Any determination \nthat an alien is ineligible under INA 212(a)(4) must be predicated upon \ncircumstances indicating that, notwithstanding any affidavit of support \nthat may have been filed on the alien's behalf, the alien is likely to \nbecome a public charge after admission, or, if applicable, that the \nalien has failed to fulfill the affidavit of support requirement of INA \n212(a)(4)(C).\n    (b) Affidavit of support. Any alien seeking an immigrant visa under \nINA 201(b)(2), 203(a), or 203(b), based upon a petition filed by a \nrelative of the alien (or in the case of a petition filed under INA \n203(b) by an entity in which a relative has a significant ownership \ninterest), shall be required to present to the consular officer an \naffidavit of support (AOS) on a form that complies with terms and \nconditions established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. \nPetitioners for applicants at a post designated by the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Visa Services for initial review of and assistance with \nsuch an AOS will be charged a fee for such review and assistance \npursuant to the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services (22 CFR 22.1).\n    (c) Joint sponsors. Submission of one or more additional affidavits \nof support by a joint sponsor/sponsors is required whenever the \nrelative sponsor's household income and significant assets, and the \nimmigrant's assets, do not meet the Federal poverty line requirements \nof INA 213A.\n    (d) Posting of bond. A consular officer may issue a visa to an \nalien who is within the purview of INA 212(a)(4) (subject to the \naffidavit of support requirement and attribution of sponsor's income \nand resources under section 213A), upon receipt of a notice from DHS of \nthe giving of a bond or undertaking in accordance with INA 213 and INA \n221(g), and provided further that the officer is satisfied that the \ngiving of such bond or undertaking removes the likelihood that the \nalien will become a public charge within the meaning of this section of \nthe law and that the alien is otherwise eligible in all respects.\n    (e) Prearranged employment. An immigrant visa applicant relying on \nan offer of prearranged employment to establish eligibility under INA \n212(a)(4), other than an offer of employment certified by the \nDepartment of Labor\n\n[[Page 60583]]\n\npursuant to INA 212(a)(5)(A), must provide written confirmation of the \nrelevant information sworn and subscribed to before a notary public by \nthe employer or an authorized employee or agent of the employer. The \nsigner's printed name and position or other relationship with the \nemployer must accompany the signature.\n    (f) Use of Federal poverty line Where INA 213A not applicable. An \nimmigrant visa applicant, not subject to the requirements of INA 213A, \nand relying solely on personal income to establish eligibility under \nINA 212(a)(4), who does not demonstrate an annual income above the \nFederal poverty line, as defined in INA 213A(h), and who is without \nother adequate financial resources, shall be presumed ineligible under \nINA 212(a)(4).\n\nHugo Rodriguez,\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Consular Affairs, \nDepartment of State.\n[FR Doc. 2023-19047 Filed 9-1-23; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4710-06-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>",

    "supplementary_information": "I. What changes to 22 CFR 41.12, 41.84, and 42.11 does this Final Rule \nmake?\n\n    The Department is amending 22 CFR 41.12 to include classification \nsymbols and related descriptions for the CW-1, CW-2, E-2C, and T-6 visa \nclassifications. The Department is also amending 22 CFR 42.11 to \ninclude classification symbols and related descriptions for surviving \nspouses and children, as described in Section 403(a) of the Emergency \nSecurity Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (``ESSAA''), Public Law \n117-31, 135 Stat. 309, as well as classification symbols and related \ndescriptions for EB-5 immigrant visas initiated by the EB-5 Reform and \nIntegrity Act of 2022, Division BB of the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2022, Public Law 117-103 (``EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act''). The \nchanges in the classification descriptions under this Final Rule will \nhave no impact on who may qualify for such a visa; as such, this Final \nRule will not practically impact any current applicant for any visa. \nThis rule also makes technical corrections to the classification \nsymbols for visa classifications to ensure the accurate inclusion of \nall active immigrant visa classifications.\n\nII Why is the Department promulgating this Final Rule?\n\nA. T Visas, Victims of Trafficking in Persons\n\n    The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, \nPublic Law 106-386 amended Section 101(a)(15)(T)(ii)(III) of the INA to \ninclude parents and unmarried siblings under the age of 18 whose \neligibility for T derivative classification is not tied to the age of \nthe principal applicant, but rather to their present danger of \nretaliation as a result of the principal's escape from trafficking or \ncooperation with law enforcement, as determined by U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. These derivatives receive T-4 and T-5 visa \nclassifications. Additionally, Section 1221 of the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act of 2013, Public Law 113-4, amended Section \n101(a)(15)(T)(ii)(III) of the INA by adding the T-6 derivative \nclassification, which is available to an eligible adult or minor child \nof a T-1 principal applicant's derivative family member, if such \nderivative's adult or minor child themself faces a present danger of \nretaliation as a result of the principal's escape from trafficking or \ncooperation with law enforcement.\n    Classification symbols in existing regulations at 22 CFR 41.12 do \nnot reflect the 2013 expansion of eligibility for the adult or minor \nchild of a derivative beneficiary, and to address this, this rule \namends 22 CFR 41.12 to add the T-6 classification symbol and \ndescription. This rule also adds details to existing descriptions of \nthe T-4 and T-5 visa classification to better reflect the statutory \ncriteria. The rule further amends 22 CFR 41.84 to reflect the current \nlanguage more closely in INA section 101(a)(15)(T)(ii) which describes \nthe family members who may qualify for T nonimmigrant status as certain \naccompanying or following-to-join derivative family members of a \nprincipal T-1 nonimmigrant. These classification codes are consistent \nwith those used by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nB. CW Visas--Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) \nTransitional Workers\n\n    Section 6 of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of \nAmerica, Public Law 94-241, as amended by Section 702(a) of the \nConsolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, Public Law 110-229, \nprovides for nonimmigrant visas for certain CNMI transitional workers, \ninvestors, and their spouses and children. The Department classifies \nCNMI transitional workers as CW-1, spouses, or children of a CW-1 as a \nCW-2, and CNMI investors and their spouses or children as E-2C. This \nrule adds these nonimmigrant visa classifications to 22 CFR 41.12. \nThese classification codes are consistent with those used by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\nC. SS1 Classification--Surviving Spouses and Children of United States \nGovernment Employees Abroad\n\n    Section 403(a) of the ESSAA amended INA Section 101(a)(27)(D), 8 \nU.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(D), to change the definition of a special immigrant \nto include ``the surviving spouse or child of an employee of the United \nStates Government abroad: Provided, [t]hat the employee performed \nfaithful service for a total of not less than 15 years or was killed in \nthe line of duty.'' The Department classifies each surviving spouse and \nchild of an employee of the United States Government abroad as an SS1. \nWhile this Final Rule does not address the parameters under which a \nnoncitizen may qualify for issuance of an SS1 immigrant visa, this rule \nadds these special immigrant visa classifications to 22 CFR 42.11.\n\nD. EB-5 Program Changes\n\n    The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act made substantial changes to \nSection 203(b)(5) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5). The EB-5 Reform and \nIntegrity Act sets forth an allocation of visas to qualified immigrant \ninvestors who invest in new commercial enterprises and satisfy \napplicable job creation requirements. Certain percentages of these \nvisas are reserved for investors in rural areas, investors in areas \ndesignated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as high \nunemployment areas, and investors in infrastructure projects.\n    The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act repealed the former Regional \nCenter Program under section 610 of Public Law 102-395 and authorized a \nnew Regional Center Program. As a result of the new legislation, the \nVisa Office is adding new EB-5 classification symbols. An investor in a \nnon-regional center for an unreserved visa is classified as NU-1 and \nthe spouse and children of an NU-1 applicant are classified as an NU-2 \nand NU-3, respectively. An investor in a regional center for an \nunreserved visa is classified as an RU-1 applicant, and the spouse and \nchildren of an RU-1 applicant are classified as an RU-2 and RU-3, \nrespectively. An applicant for a reserved visa who is an investor in a\n\n[[Page 45069]]\n\nnon-regional center in a rural area is classified as an NR-1, and the \nspouse and children of an NR-1 applicant are classified as an NR-2 and \nNR-3, respectively. An applicant for a reserved visa who is an investor \nin a non-regional center in an area with high unemployment is \nclassified as an NH-1, and the spouse and children of an NH-1 applicant \nare classified as an NH-2 and NH-3, respectively. An applicant for a \nreserved visa who is an investor in a regional center in a rural area \nis classified as an RR-1, and the spouse and children of an RR-1 \napplicant are classified as an RR-2 and RR-3, respectively. An \napplicant for a reserved visa who is an investor in a regional center \nin an area of high unemployment is classified as an RH-1, and the \nspouse and children of an RH-1 applicant are classified as an RH-2 and \nRH-3, respectively. An applicant for a reserved visa who is an investor \nin an infrastructure project is classified as an RI-1, and the spouse \nand children of an RI-1 applicant are classified as an RI-2 and RI-3, \nrespectively. The previously used visa classifications for employment \nfifth preference immigrant visas (C51, C52, C53, T51, T52, T53, R51, \nR52, R53, I51, I52, and I53) will continue to be used for EB-5 \nimmigrant visa applicants who had petitions pending with DHS at the \ntime of the passage of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act. These \nclassification symbols and descriptions are currently in use, and \nmerely reflect the availability of these classifications for qualified \napplicants. The publication of these symbols will not impact processing \nof visas in other categories for any current or future applicant. These \nclassification symbols are consistent with those used by the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n\nE. Technical Changes\n\n    Additionally, this rule makes a technical change to remove a \nreference to H2R, which is a classification symbol no longer in use. \nThe H2R nonimmigrant visa classification was introduced by Section 402 \nof the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \nGlobal War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005, Public Law 109-13, as \namended by Section 565 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, \nPublic Law 114-113. The H2R nonimmigrant visa classification was only \nauthorized through the end of the 2016 fiscal year and has not been \nreauthorized.\n\nF. Terminology\n\n    President Biden's Executive Order 14012, Executive Order on \nRestoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening \nIntegration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans (Feb. 2, 2021), \naffirms that the ``Federal Government should develop welcoming \nstrategies that promote integration [and] inclusion.'' That Executive \nOrder and Executive Order 14010, Creating a Comprehensive Regional \nFramework to Address the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration \nThroughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly \nProcessing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border (Feb. 2, \n2021), do not use the terms ``alien'' or ``illegal alien'' to describe \nmigrants.\n    Some opinions of the Supreme Court now use the term ``noncitizen'' \nin place of ``alien.'' See, e.g., United States v. Palomar-Santiago, \n141 S. Ct. 1615, 1619 (2021); Barton v. Barr, 140 S. Ct. 1442, 1446 n.2 \n(2020) (``This opinion uses the term `noncitizen' as equivalent to the \nstatutory term `alien.' '') (citing 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)).\\1\\ Other \nagencies have begun to use noncitizen in place of alien in regulations \nand guidance and the Department has been using noncitizen and applicant \nin place of alien in guidance to consular officers since mid-2021. The \nDepartment intends to gradually replace or remove references to alien \nas it makes other amendments to its regulations in 22 CFR parts 41, and \n42, and has done so in several descriptions of its nonimmigrant and \nimmigrant visa classifications in this rule.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nA. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    The publication of this rule as a final rule is based upon the \n``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3). A \nrule benefits from the good cause exception when the ``agency for good \ncause finds . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are \nimpractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' \\1\\ The \nDepartment finds that notice and comment for this rule are unnecessary \nas this rule proposes no new policy or procedure. This rule merely \nupdates the list of classification symbols found in 22 CFR 41.12 and \n42.11 to more closely reflect the classifications authorized under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act and other federal statutes; and \nprovides clarifying descriptions in the associated classification-\nspecific subsections.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For this reason, this rule is excepted from the notice and comment \nrequirements of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    As this final rule is excepted from notice and comment rulemaking \nunder 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and 553(a), it is exempt from the regulatory \nflexibility analysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).\n\nC. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1532, generally \nrequires agencies to prepare a statement before proposing any rule that \nmay result in an annual expenditure of $100 million or more by State, \nlocal, or Tribal governments, or by the private sector. This rule does \nnot require the Department of State to prepare a statement because it \nwill not result in any such expenditure, nor will it significantly or \nuniquely affect small governments. This rule involves visas, which \ninvolve foreign individuals, and does not directly or substantially \naffect state, local, or tribal governments, or businesses.\n\nD. Congressional Review Act of 1996\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 804. This rule \nwill not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or \nmore; a major increase in costs or prices; or adverse effects on \ncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the \nability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign-based \ncompanies in domestic and import markets.\n\nE. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess costs \nand benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is \nnecessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits \n(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety \neffects, distributed impacts, and equity). These Executive Orders \nstress the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of \nreducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The \nDepartment of State has examined this rule considering Executive Order \n13563 and has determined that the rulemaking is consistent with the \nguidance therein. The Department of State has reviewed this rulemaking \nto ensure its consistency with the regulatory philosophy and principles \nset forth in Executive Order 12866. The Office of\n\n[[Page 45070]]\n\nInformation and Regulatory Affairs has designated this rule \n``significant'' in accordance with E.O. 12866. There are no anticipated \ndirect costs to the public associated with this rule.\n\nF. Executive Orders 12372 and 13132: Federalism\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effect on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Nor will the rule have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nG. Executive Order 12988: Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department of State has reviewed the rule considering sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburden.\n\nH. Executive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments\n\n    The Department of State has determined that this rulemaking will \nnot have Tribal implications, will not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian Tribal governments, and will not pre-empt \nTribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive \nOrder 13175 do not apply to this rulemaking.\n\nI. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35.\n\nList of Subjects\n\n22 CFR Part 41\n\n    Aliens, Foreign officials, Passports and visas, Students.\n\n22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Fees, Foreign \nofficials, Immigration passports and visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, and under the \nauthority 8 U.S.C. 1104 and 22 U.S.C. 2651(a), 22 CFR parts 41 and 42 \nare amended as follows:\n\nPART 41--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF NONIMMIGRANTS UNDER THE \nIMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 41 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  8 U.S.C. 1101; 1102; 1104; 1182; 1184; 1185 note \n(section 7209 of Pub.

    "supplementary_information": "I. What changes to 22 CFR 22.1 and 42.71 does this TFR make?\n\n    The Department is temporarily amending 22 CFR 22.1 and 42.71 to \nexempt Afghan nationals from the requirement to pay the IV application \nprocessing and domestic Affidavit of Support review fees if they are \napplying for an IV as an immediate relative as defined in section \n201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \n1151(b)(2)(A)(i) or in a family preference IV category as provided in \nsection 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \n1153(a).\n\nII. Why is the Department making these changes?\n\n    Since the fall of the Afghan government in August 2021, the United \nStates has welcomed more than 88,000 Afghans through Operation Allies \nWelcome (OAW), an all-of-government effort to relocate to the United \nStates citizens and lawful permanent residents who wished to leave \nAfghanistan, along with special immigrant visa (SIV) applicants, \nimmediate family members of SIV applicants, and other Afghans at risk. \nMany additional Afghans who did not relocate to the United States \nthrough OAW but who qualify for an IV as an immediate relative or in a \nfamily preference IV category because they have qualifying \nrelationships with a U.S. citizen or U.S. lawful permanent resident and \nseek to immigrate to the United States.\n    On August 31, 2021, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan \nsuspended operations indefinitely.\\1\\ Since that time, the Department \nhas continued its efforts to assist U.S. citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and other Afghans at risk through its Office of the \nCoordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts. In the absence of regular \nconsular operations in Afghanistan, Afghans applying for an immigrant \nvisa must apply and personally appear at a U.S. Embassy or consulate in \nanother country.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Security Message: Suspension of Operations, <a href=\"https://af.usembassy.gov/security-message-suspension-of-operations/\">https://af.usembassy.gov/security-message-suspension-of-operations/</a> (August \n31, 2021).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Under section 222(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1152(a), every noncitizen \napplying for an immigrant visa is required to submit an application in \nthe form and manner and at such place as\n\n[[Page 35739]]\n\nprescribed by regulation. In accordance with the Department's \nregulations, an individual applying for an immigrant visa must pay the \nfee prescribed by the Secretary of State for the processing of \nimmigrant visa applications, subject to limited, enumerated exceptions. \n22 CFR 42.71; see also 22 CFR 22.1. Immigrant visa application \nprocessing fees are listed in Item 32 within the Department's Schedule \nof Fees for Consular Services (``Schedule of Fees''), published at 22 \nCFR 22.1. The immigrant visa application processing fee for an \nindividual applying as an immediate relative or for a visa in a family \npreference IV category is $325.\n    Section 212(a)(4)(C)(ii) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C)(ii), \nprovides that the person petitioning for an applicant's admission, and \nany additional or alternative sponsor, as appropriate, must execute an \naffidavit of support (Form I-864) as described in section 213A of the \nINA, 8 U.S.C. 1183a. The National Visa Center reviews, for clerical \ncompleteness, Form I-864 and related documents for applicants who are \nthe beneficiary of a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, submitted \nto USCIS. The Department charges a fee for Affidavit of Support review \nwhen the affidavit is reviewed domestically. The current domestic \nAffidavit of Support review fee is $120.\n    This temporary final rule will provide for fee exemptions to \nqualified applicants through December 31, 2024, and is designed to help \nAfghan nationals resettle and, in many cases, reunite with family \nmembers in the United States. These exemptions reflect the Department's \nongoing commitment to resettle Afghan nationals at risk due to the fall \nof the Afghan government, as they will facilitate the reunification of \nAfghans with their qualifying family members in the United States. \nThese fee exemptions are not retroactive.\n    The Department is publishing this rule as a temporary final rule, \nwhich will automatically expire on December 31, 2024. The Department \nanticipates that this duration is a sufficient time period for Afghan \nnationals who are at risk and who wish to immigrate to the United \nStates to benefit from the fee relief. This rule applies to \napplications dated after the effective date of this rulemaking.\n\nIII. Regulatory Findings\n\nA. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    As this rule involves a foreign affairs function of the United \nStates, it is excepted from both the delayed effective date and notice \nand comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).\n    Under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1), notice-and-comment requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act do not apply ``to the extent there is \ninvolved . . . a military or foreign affairs function of the United \nStates.'' This exemption applies when the rule in question ``is clearly \nand directly involved in a foreign affairs function.'' Mast Indus. v. \nRegan, 596 F. Supp. 1567, 1582 (C.I.T. 1984) (quotation marks omitted). \nIn addition, although the text of the Administrative Procedure Act does \nnot require an agency invoking this exemption to show that such \nprocedures may result in ``definitely undesirable international \nconsequences,'' some courts have required such a showing. E.g., Yassini \nv. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1360 n.4 (9th Cir. 1980). This rule \nsatisfies both standards.\n    This rulemaking to exempt Afghan nationals from certain IV fees \nclearly and directly involves foreign affairs, as the U.S. government's \ncommitment and efforts in furtherance of Operation Allies Welcome, \nEnduring Welcome, and successor operations to relocate and resettle \nAfghans who have provided valuable assistance to the U.S. government \nover the past two decades, and their family members, reflects one of \nthe U.S. government's most significant foreign policy goals in recent \nyears. These measures specifically will significantly ease the \nfinancial burden of Afghan applicants seeking to join U.S. citizen or \nlawful permanent resident family members in the United States, clearly \nand directly reflecting U.S. foreign policy as the Department seeks to \nuphold its commitments to assist many Afghans and their family members \nwho have assisted the U.S. government. Visa applicants from Afghanistan \nare currently unable to apply in their home country due to the \nsuspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and must travel \nto other locations, often at their own cost and risk. For such \nindividuals, particularly those of whom are applying for immediate \nrelative and family preference immigrant visas, the payment of visa \nprocessing fees and fees for domestic processing of the Affidavit of \nSupport, are significant, with each applicant paying $445 in immigrant \nvisa processing fees alone, in addition to other associated required \nfees not addressed by this rulemaking, including for example the cost \nof a required medical examination and travel expenses to the United \nStates. These significant costs can serve as a barrier to applicants \ncompleting their applications and being able to travel to the United \nStates to reunite with family members, and consequently, this \nrulemaking to exempt such applicants from certain fees clearly and \ndirectly involves a foreign affairs function.\n    Similarly, solicitation of public notice and comment to this \nforeign policy exercise would have definitely undesirable international \nconsequences. Foreign governments or parts thereof may have interests \nin this rule as a matter of their foreign policy goals with respect to \nU.S. efforts to relocate and resettle Afghan Allies and other Afghans \nat risk, many of whom must transit and complete visa processing in \nthird countries in order to immigrate to the United States. Foreign \ngovernments or entities, including entities that oppose U.S. \nobjectives, may seek to disrupt and potentially harm the bilateral \nrelationships between the U.S. and such countries through participation \nin the notice and comment process. As a DOJ representative stated \nduring hearings on the Administrative Procedure Act, ``[a] requirement \nof public participation in . . . promulgation of rules to govern our \nrelationships with other nations . . . would encourage public \ndemonstrations by extremist factions which might embarrass foreign \nofficials and seriously prejudice our conduct of foreign affairs.'' \nAdministrative Procedure Act: Hearings on S. 1663 Before the Subcomm. \non Admin. Practice & Procedure of the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 88th \nCong. at 363 (1964). The time necessary to solicit and respond to \npublic comments on the rule would further delay State's ability to \nexempt these individuals from immigrant visa fees, significantly \nhampering State's ability to advance the described foreign policy \nobjectives of upholding the U.S. government's commitment to the Afghan \npeople.\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires \nagencies to perform an analysis of the potential impact of regulations \non small business entities when regulations are subject to the notice \nand comment procedures of the APA. As this TFR is not required to be \npublished for notice and comment under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Nonetheless, as \nthis action only directly impacts a small subset of immigrant visa \napplicants, the Department certifies that this rule will not have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\n[[Page 35740]]\n\nC. Congressional Review Act of 1996\n\n    In the Department's view, this TFR is not a major rule as defined \nin 5 U.S.C. 804. This TFR will not result in an annual effect on the \neconomy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices; \nor adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, \nproductivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based \ncompanies to compete with foreign-based companies in domestic and \nimport markets.\n\nD. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This TFR does not impose any new reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 35.\n\nE. Executive Order 12866\n\n    The Department has reviewed this TFR to ensure its consistency with \nthe regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in Executive Order \n12866. This rule will temporarily exempt certain Afghan applicants from \nthe payment of the IV application processing and domestic Affidavit of \nSupport review fees. There are no anticipated costs to the public \nassociated with this rule. The Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs has designated this rule as non-significant.\n\nF. Executive Order 13175\n\n    The Department has determined this rulemaking will not have Tribal \nimplications, will not impose substantial direct compliance costs on \nIndian Tribal governments, and will not pre-empt Tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nG.

    "supplementary_information": "Background\n\n    This rule makes changes to the Schedule of Fees, found at 22 CFR \n22.1. The Department generally sets and collects fees for consular \nservices based on the concept of full cost recovery to the U.S. \nGovernment. The Department's CoSM uses an Activity-Based Costing (ABC) \nmethodology to calculate annually the direct and indirect costs to the \nU.S. Government associated with each consular good and service the \nDepartment provides. The CoSM provides a comprehensive and detailed \nlook at all consular services as well as all services that the \nDepartment performs for other agencies in connection with its consular \noperations. Fees are based on these cost estimates and the Department \naims to update the Schedule of Fees biennially unless a significant \nchange in costs warrants an immediate recommendation to amend the \nSchedule.\n    The most recently approved update to the CoSM indicated that fee \nincreases were needed to fully recover the costs of providing several \ncategories of NIV services. As a result, the Department published an \nNPRM in the Federal Register on December 29, 2021 (86 FR 74018), for a \n60-day public comment period that ended on February 28, 2022. The NPRM \nproposed the following increases:\n    <bullet> The application processing fee for non-petition-based \nnonimmigrant visas (except E category), from $160 to $245;\n    <bullet> The application processing fee for H, L, O, P, Q, and R \ncategory nonimmigrant visas, from $190 to $310;\n    <bullet> The application processing fee for E category nonimmigrant \nvisas, from $205 to $485;\n    <bullet> The processing fee for BCCs for Mexican citizens age 15 \nand over from $160 to $245: and\n    <bullet> The fee for waiver of the two-year residency requirement \nfor exchange visitors, from $120 to $510.\n    As discussed in more depth in the NPRM, the unit costs that inform \nthe recommended fees for each NIV service were calculated by taking the \ntotal cost of each service and dividing by the 10-year average number \nof receipts (i.e., demand) for that service.\n    The fee increases that will be implemented as a result of this \nfinal rule are smaller than those proposed in the NPRM due to revised \nprojections for fiscal year (FY) 2022-2024 demand. The CoSM uses \nhistorical workloads as well as projected future workloads to calculate \ndemand for each service. Projecting future demand is extremely \ndifficult because travel for both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals \ncan change quickly and dramatically, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 \npandemic. Therefore, the current model update applied a 10-year average \nfor workload volumes for NIVs, using historic workload actuals from FYs \n2015-2019 and projected workload volumes for FYs 2020-2024. Using a 10-\nyear average helped minimize the impact of demand volatility on unit \ncost calculations. Recognizing that actual demand will always vary, \nthis practical approach helped to stabilize fees at an amount \nsufficient to recover costs with only a modest increase to the \nconsumer. See 86 FR 74018, 74020-21.\n    The fee increases proposed in the NPRM were based on a 10-year \naverage of 7.7 million NIVs of all classes per year. After the NPRM was \nissued, however, it became apparent that demand for NIVs was rebounding \nsignificantly faster than previously anticipated and that actual demand \nwould exceed the projected volume in the NPRM. The Department therefore \ndecided to recalculate demand before moving forward with the final rule \nto ensure that it did not implement fees in\n\n[[Page 18244]]\n\nexcess of its actual costs. In its revised analysis, the Department \nincluded historic actual workload amounts for FY2015-2021 (rather than \nFY2015-2019 as in the original recommendations) and revised projected \nworkload amounts for FY2022-2024. As with the original calculations, \nthe Department divided the total actual and projected demand by 10, \nwhich resulted in a revised 10-year average of 9.5 million NIVs of all \nclasses per year.\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28MR23.000\n\n    Because actual costs and level of effort for most categories of \nNIVs have been relatively stable over this period, the significant \nincrease in average demand generates a corresponding decrease in the \nunit costs of providing these services. As a result, the Department \nwill implement smaller fee increases than originally proposed for all \ncategories of NIVs.\n    The Department is also postponing the fee increase for the exchange \nvisitor waiver of two-year residency requirement (``J-Waiver'') fee. \nUnlike machine-readable visa (MRV) fees, which must be set at the cost \nof providing nonimmigrant visa application processing and border \ncrossing card processing services, see 8 U.S.C. 1713(b); 8 U.S.C. 1351 \n(note), the Department has discretion to take factors other than cost \ninto account when setting the J-Waiver fee. See 31 U.S.C. 9701 \n(permitting the Government to consider ``other relevant facts'' in \naddition to costs when setting fees); Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB) Circular A-25, Section 6(c)(2)(b) (recognizing exceptions to the \ngeneral policy of full cost recovery when conditions exist that justify \nan exception); see also 22 U.S.C. 1475e (authorizing the Department to \nretain fees related to Exchange Visitor Program services ``to such \nextent as may be provided in advance in appropriations acts'' and \nexpend such fees for ``authorized purposes'' without specifying the \namount at which the fees much be set). Although the costs of providing \nthe J-Waiver service have increased as indicated in the NPRM, the \nDepartment has assessed that currently available retained revenue from \nthis fee is sufficient to permit the Department to sustain the J-Waiver \nservice in the near term without raising the fee at this time.\n    Below are the adjustments to the fee recommendations in the NPRM \nthat the Department will implement in this final rule:\n    <bullet> The application processing fee for non-petition based NIVs \n(except E category), will be raised from $160 to $185. This represents \na 15.6 percent increase over the current fee, but is $60 or 24.5 \npercent below the original proposal of $245.\n    <bullet> The application processing fee for H, L, O, P, Q, and R \ncategory NIVs, will be raised from $190 to $205. This represents a 7.9 \npercent increase over the current fee, but is $105 or 33.9 percent \nbelow the original proposal of $310.\n    <bullet> The processing fee for the BCCs for Mexican citizens age \n15 and over will be raised from $160 to $185. This represents a 15.6 \npercent increase over the current fee, but is $60 or 24.5 percent below \nthe original proposal of $245.\n    <bullet> The fee for E category NIVs will be raised from $205 to \n$315. This represents a 53.7 percent increase over the current fee, but \nis $170 or 35 percent below the original proposal of $485.\n    <bullet> The fee for the exchange visitor waiver of two-year \nresidency requirement will be maintained at $120, instead of the \nproposed $510.\n    As discussed above, the Department applied the same methodology to \ncalculate the revised fees and the relevant authorities found in the \nNPRM apply to these revised fee recommendations. This rule also \naddresses public comments received by the Department on the originally \nproposed fee recommendations found in the NPRM.\n\nAnalysis of Comments\n\n    In the 60-day period following publication of the NPRM, the \nDepartment received a total of 328 comments, 94 of which were \nduplicates. The comments are categorized into the following general \ntopics.\n\nEducation\n\n    The Department received many comments related to the proposed \nincrease from $160 to $245 for non-petition based nonimmigrant visas \n(except E category), which include all types of student visas. Sixty-\none commenters expressed concerns about the impact of the fee increases \non international education, including the following sub-topics: 10 \ncomments on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects international students \nand institutions of higher education in the United States; 11 comments \non how the English as a Second Language (ESL) community\n\n[[Page 18245]]\n\nmight be affected; 6 comments on the Biden Administration's policies \nfor attracting international students; and 15 comments on the \npossibility that an increase of this kind might drive international \nstudents to seek educational opportunities in other countries. As \ndiscussed above, this final rule implements only a $25 increase for \nnon-petition-based NIV fees, from $160 to $185. The Department believes \nthis modification largely addresses the issues raised by the \ncommenters, which appeared to be driven by financial impact on visa \napplicants.\n\nGradual Increase\n\n    The Department received 19 comments from commenters who accepted \nthe proposed fee increases but requested that the Department delay the \nincreases to sometime in the future or make them more gradual. The \nDepartment's decision to increase the non-petition-based NIV (except E \ncategory) fee by only $25 rather than $85 and to increase the NIV fee \nfor H, L, O, P, Q, and R category visas by only $15 rather than $120 \nfor the reasons discussed above addresses the concerns raised by these \ncommenters.\n\nTemporary Work Visas (Agricultural (H-2As) and Non-Agricultural (H-\n2Bs))\n\n    The Department received 80 comments regarding the H-2 visa \nprograms. These comments were in response to the Department's original \nproposal that would have increased the fee from $190 to $310, and \ngenerally asserted that agricultural businesses cannot absorb a 63 \npercent increase to H-2 visa fees. The comments also asserted that with \nrising prices across the board (e.g., increases in the Adverse Effect \nWage Rate (AEWR)), the fee increase would put them out of business. As \ndiscussed in the NPRM, the impact of the proposed fee increases on the \noverall cost of bringing over an H-2 worker would have been minimal. If \nimplemented, the proposed fee would have raised the total cost by just \nover one percent, from $10,367 ($10,177 + $190) to $10,487 ($10,177 + \n$310). See 86 FR 74023. This final rule implements only a $15 increase \nin petition-based NIV fees, from $190 to $205. Assuming the costs of \nbringing over an H-2 worker have not increased since the NPRM was \nissued, the total cost is now increasing by only .15 percent (from \n$10,367 to $10,382). This is significantly less than originally \nproposed, which should largely address the concerns of the commenters.\n\nAdverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR)\n\n    One commenter requested that if the fees are increased, then the \n``AEWR should be removed, frozen, or replaced with a charge that isn't \nconstantly increased.'' The AEWR, which is determined by the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification \nAdministrator for the purpose of preventing the employment of H-2A \nworkers from adversely affecting the wages of U.S. workers similarly \nemployed, see 8 U.S.C. 1188(a)(1)(B), is ``[t]he annual weighted \naverage hourly wage for field and livestock workers (combined) in the \nStates or regions as published annually by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture (USDA) based on its quarterly wage survey.'' 20 CFR \n655.103(c). An employer whose Application for Temporary Employment \nCertification in the H-2A program has been certified by the Department \nof Labor must offer, advertise in its recruitment, and pay a wage that \nis at least the highest of the AEWR, a prevailing wage rate, an agreed-\nupon collective bargaining wage, the Federal minimum wage, or the State \nminimum wage. 20 CFR 655.120(a). The Department recognizes that an AEWR \nor other minimum wage under the H-2A program may impose a financial \nburden on agricultural employers; however, it is a requirement imposed \nby the Immigration and Naturalization Act, as implemented by the \nDepartment of Labor's H-2A regulations, which is outside the scope of \nthis rulemaking.\n\nTourism\n\n    The Department received one comment that specifically discussed the \nimpact the proposed fee increases could have on tourism demand. The \nNPRM examined the costs associated with tourist visits to the United \nStates and the potential impact of the original proposed fee increase \non demand for tourism. Our analysis showed that even with the \noriginally proposed $85 increase, from $160 to $245, the impact on \ntourism likely would have been minimal.\n    Due to the revised demand projections, the Department is now \nimplementing only a $25 increase to the fee for non-petition based NIVs \n(except E category). Assuming the average costs of travel to the United \nStates ($4,834) have not increased since the publication of the NPRM, \nthen the adjustment to the fee will increase the total cost of a trip \nfrom $4,994 ($4,834 + $160) (current rate) to $5,019 ($4,834 + $185), \nwhich is less than one-half of one percent. Thus, the impact on tourism \nalmost certainly will be negligible.\n    The commenter also mentioned that by increasing the tourist visa \nfee, the Department risks increased reciprocity fees imposed by other \ncountries, which will negatively impact Americans who wish to travel \ninternationally. The Department acknowledges this risk but must set MRV \nfees to recover the costs of providing these services. See 8 U.S.C. \n1713(b).\n\nEvidence of Reason for Increase\n\n    The Department received six comments requesting additional evidence \nto help commenters understand the reasons for the increases. As \ndetailed in the NPRM, while costs for non-petition-based nonimmigrant \nvisas (except E category) and the petition-based nonimmigrant visa \nservices have increased modestly but steadily since the last adjustment \nto these fees in 2012, demand for these visa categories has fluctuated \nmore dramatically from year to year. See 86 FR 74021. Because MRV fees \nmust be set at the cost of providing these services, 8 U.S.C. 1713(b), \nthe unprecedented, significant decrease in demand due to the COVID-19 \npandemic had a substantial impact on the fee increases proposed in the \nNPRM. Subsequently, the Department observed a considerable, unexpected \nrecovery in NIV demand and made the decision to reanalyze the proposed \nfees in light of this rebound.\n    The Department cannot be certain why NIV demand has recovered more \nquickly than expected. The recovery in demand may be attributable to a \nvariety of factors, including the increase in global vaccination rates, \nrelaxation of travel restrictions and reopening of international \nborders, and gradual resumption of the Department's visa operations at \noverseas posts. When the initial projected demand for 2021-2024 was \ncalculated, it was uncertain whether effective COVID-19 vaccines would \nbe globally available and what impact vaccination would have on demand \nfor NIVs. The relatively quick proliferation of COVID-19 vaccines \nworldwide and the corresponding reductions in the risk of serious \nillness and death due to COVID-19 may have increased individuals' \nwillingness to travel and the easing of restrictions made it \nincreasingly possible to do so. Regardless, because the CoSM assumed a \nnegative outlook for a longer period, the original demand projections \nultimately were too low.\n    The revised fee recommendation for E category NIVs reflects a \ndecrease of $170 from the original proposal, from $205 to $315 rather \nthan $485. As with the other categories of NIVs, the originally\n\n[[Page 18246]]\n\nproposed fee increase for E NIVs accounted for very low demand for this \nservice during the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed in the NPRM, \nhowever, the proposed increase also reflected an increased level of \neffort on the part of the adjudicator. The most recent CoSM \ndemonstrated that consular staff spend significantly more time \nproviding this service than was captured previously. See 86 FR 74018, \n74022. The fee that will be implemented includes NIV adjudication \nefforts that were not previously captured in the current fee (as \ndiscussed in the NRPM), and accounts for the improved outlook for E \nvisa demand.\n\nActivity-Based Costing Methodology and Calculations\n\n    The Department received two comments related to its Activity-Based \nCosting (ABC) methodology and calculations. One commenter pointed out \nthe ``vast majority of the cost of processing visa applications is \ndirectly proportional to the number of applications'' and that CA \nshould consider fixed costs of services to be minimal in unit cost \ncalculations. The cost of processing visa applications is not directly \nproportional to the number of applications. A significant portion of \ncosts are fixed, including costs for rent and utilities as well as \nbureau, directorate, and post management. As discussed above, these \ncosts have increased steadily due primarily to inflation since the last \nadjustments to these fees. Although the considerable fluctuations in \ndemand due to the COVID-19 pandemic had a greater impact on the \nproposed fee increases, the rise in actual costs had an impact on the \nfees as well.\n    One commenter mentioned that the Department's ABC model should \nconsider visa validity when calculating the fees for services. The \nDepartment does not set NIV application processing fees based on the \nnumber of years a visa is valid, because the costs associated with visa \nprocessing do not vary significantly whether the length of validity is \none year or ten years, or whether a visa is for a single entry or \nmultiple entries.\n\nSame Level of Service (Backlog)\n\n    The Department received four comments stating that the commenter \nwould gladly pay an increased fee for faster service (i.e., decreased \nwait times), but did not support fee increases to obtain the same level \nof service currently provided. The Department understands the concerns \nregarding visa processing times. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in \nprofound reductions in the Department's visa processing capacity, and \nmany embassies and consulates were able to provide only limited visa \nservices. As worldwide restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic ease, \nthe Department is focused on reducing wait times for all consular \nservices at our embassies and consulates overseas while also protecting \nthe health and safety of our staff and applicants when they come to \nembassy or consular premises. Although local conditions and \nrestrictions at individual consular posts may continue to fluctuate, \nembassies and consulates have broad discretion to determine how to \nprioritize visa appointments among the ranges of visa classes as safely \nas possible, subject to local conditions and restrictions. The \nDepartment sets MRV fees at the cost of providing the service, see 8 \nU.S.C. 1713(b), and these fees are used to cover the costs of the \nservice, including the materials, office space, equipment, etc. needed \nto process and produce NIVs.\n\nDomestic Renewals (Visa Reissuance in the U.S. for Certain Visa \nHolders)\n\n    The Department received 75 comments suggesting and requesting that \nthe Department resume domestic visa renewals for individuals who were \npreviously approved to receive certain visa classes (e.g., H-1B, H-4, \nGreen Cards) and previously provided biometrics. These commenters \nassert that such renewals would eliminate the requirement for these \nindividuals to travel to their home country to renew their visas, where \nthey may need to remain for uncertain periods of time before they can \nobtain interview appointments at the embassy or consulate.\n    The State Department provided domestic renewals until the 2002 \nEnhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act required that U.S. \nvisas issued after October 26, 2004, include biometric identifiers. \nThis, in turn, required visa holders to renew their visas outside the \nUnited States, because domestic fingerprint collection was not feasible \nat the time. The possibility of relying on previously collected \nfingerprints would overcome one obstacle to resuming domestic renewal. \nAs part of the Department's ongoing commitment to exploring options to \nmake visa processing more efficient and accessible for all applicants, \nthe Department is assessing numerous logistical challenges that need to \nbe addressed in implementing such an initiative. The Department \ncontinues to explore options to make visa processing more efficient and \naccessible for all applicants.\n\nConclusion\n\n    The Department will adjust application processing fees for NIVs and \nadult BCC fees in light of the Cost of Service Model's findings that \nthe U.S. Government is not fully recovering the costs of processing \napplications for several categories of NIVs and the adult BCC. The \nDepartment is postponing the fee increase for the J-Waiver fee, which \nwill remain at $120. In accordance with its statutory authorities and \nconsistent with OMB guidance, the Department sets user fees at a level \nsufficient to recover the cost of providing services that provide \nspecial benefits to an identifiable recipient beyond those that accrue \nto the general public. See 31 U.S.C. 9701; OMB Circular A-25, sec. \n6(a)(1), (a)(2)(a); see also 8 U.S.C. 1713(b). For this reason, the \nDepartment will adjust the Schedule of Fees.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department published this rulemaking as a proposed rule and \nprovided 60 days for public comment. This final rule will be effective \n60 days after publication, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(3).\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    The Department has reviewed this rule and, by approving it, \ncertifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601(6). \nThis rule adjusts the application processing fees for H, L, O, P, Q and \nR category visas, which will account for approximately eleven percent \nof the total nonimmigrant visa workload expected in FY2023. Although \nthe issuance of some of these visas is contingent upon approval by DHS \nof a petition filed by a United States company with DHS, and these \ncompanies pay a fee to DHS to cover the processing of the petition, the \nvisa itself is sought and paid for by an individual foreign national \noverseas who seeks to come to the United States or, in some cases, an \nemployer applying on their behalf. The amount of the petition fees that \nare paid by small entities to DHS is not impacted by the amount of the \nvisa fees paid by individuals to the Department of State. While small \nentities may cover or reimburse employees for application processing \nfees, the exact number of such entities that do so is unknown. Whether \nor not small entities choose to reimburse the applicant for their \nemployment-based NIV fees, the $15 increase is not likely to have a \nsignificant economic impact.\n\n[[Page 18247]]\n\nUnfunded Mandates Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not result in the expenditure by state, local, and \ntribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 \nmillion or more in any year, and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 \nU.S.C. 1501-1504.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    This rule is a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563\n\n    The Department has reviewed this rule to ensure its consistency \nwith the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in E.O. 12866 \nand E.O. 13563. OMB has determined that this rule is economically \nsignificant under Executive Order 12866.\na. Need for the Regulatory Action\n    This final rule is necessary in light of the CoSM's findings that \ncosts associated with NIV application processing have increased since \nthe last update to these fees. The Department sets NIV application fees \ncommensurate with the costs of providing these services in accordance \nwith 8 U.S.C. 1713(b) and OMB Circular A-25. The increase in costs \ntherefore justify these adjustments through the rulemaking process.\nb.

FY 2023 is the year likely year of implementation.\n\\2\\ Change in fee collection is based on FY2023 projected workload x change to fee.\n\n    As explained above, the results of the most recent CoSM indicate \nthat the costs of providing nonimmigrant visa services have increased \nand therefore the current fees are not set at a level sufficient to \npermit the Department to fully recover the costs of providing these \nservices. The Department relies exclusively on retained revenue from \nconsular fee collections to fund ongoing consular operations. The NIV \nfees proposed by the Department are set to recover costs necessary to \nsupport NIV operations, in accordance with 8 U.S.C. 1713(b) and OMB \nCircular A-25. If any of these fees are set below costs, the \nDepartment's Bureau of Consular Affairs would be operating at a \ndeficit. Such a situation could impact the Department's ability to \nprovide consular services to those who seek to travel to the United \nStates for tourism, education, or work-related reasons, by limiting \naccess to resources needed to adjudicate and produce visas. That \nconsequence, in turn, could have a negative effect on those aspects of \nthe U.S. economy that depends on these visitors and workers.\nc. Time Horizon of the Analysis\n    The Department's CoSM is updated annually, and the Department aims \nto update the Schedule of Fees biennially unless a significant change \nin costs warrants an immediate recommendation to amend the Schedule. If \nthe results of the CoSM indicate a change in the cost (increase/\ndecrease) of providing a service, then adjustments to the relevant fees \nwill be made to ensure full cost recovery. Any future changes to the \nfees, however, will not impact NIV holders during the period of their \nvisa's validity (generally 5-10 years).\nd. Regulatory Alternatives\n    Due to the requirements of 8 U.S.C. 1713(b), there are no \nalternatives to raising MRV fees. However, as discussed in the \npreamble, the Department is finalizing lower increases than those \nproposed in the NPRM due to the rebound in demand for NIVs. As in the \nNPRM, the Department utilized 10-year average for demand to account for \npandemic-related volatility and the fact that demand for NIVs is still \nin the process of recovering. The fees included in this rule are set at \nthe cost of providing the relevant nonimmigrant\n\n[[Page 18248]]\n\nvisa services and are used to cover the costs of those services, \nincluding the materials, offices, equipment, etc. needed to process and \nproduce NIVs.\n    Therefore, the Department has no alternative to this rulemaking; if \nthe Department does not recover costs for these NIV services, the \nDepartment will be operating at a deficit and its consular operations \ncould be impeded.\ne. Costs & Benefits of the Rule\n    The NPRM includes a section titled, ``Economic Impact'' that \ndemonstrated that the proposed fee increases resulted in minimal \nincreases in the totality of overall costs to both travelers and those \nseeking work visas. The economic impact of these fee increases is also \ndiscussed in the sections of this final rule responding to public \ncomments. For the reasons discussed, the Department does not believe \nthat the increased NIV application processing costs will deter non-U.S. \ncitizens from applying for visas, because these fee increases do not \nsignificantly impact the costs of an applicant's travel to the United \nStates.\n    Although economic impact on individual applicants is minimal, these \nfee increases will generate revenue that will be used to cover the \ncosts of providing consular services. This revenue will help guarantee \nthe continued functioning of the Department's consular operations, \nwhich will provide a direct benefit to U.S. citizens. The fees set \nthrough this rulemaking will not change unless and until the results of \na future CoSM indicate that they need to be adjusted. As noted above, \nthe Department does not anticipate any change in demand for visas \nservices because of this rulemaking. The cost of an NIV remains minor \nin comparison with other costs associated with travel, education, or \nhiring a worker from abroad, as detailed in the NPRM.\n\nExecutive Order 12372 and 13132\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nstates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nstates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with section 6 \nof E.O. 13132, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient \nfederalism implications to require consultations or warrant the \npreparation of a federalism summary impact statement. The regulations \nimplementing E.O. 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on \nFederal programs and activities do not apply to this regulation.\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not preempt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of E.O. 13175 do not apply to this \nrulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 22\n\n    Consular services, Fees.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, 22 CFR part 22 \nis amended as follows:\n\nPART 22--SCHEDULE OF FEES FOR CONSULAR SERVICES--DEPARTMENT OF \nSTATE AND FOREIGN SERVICE\n\n0\n1.

    "supplementary_information": "I. Background\n\n    Applicants for immigrant visas subject to numerical limitations \nprescribed in sections 201-203 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1151-1153, are \ngenerally chargeable to their country of birth. INA 203(e), 8 U.S.C. \n1153(e), governs the order in which immigrant visas in the family-\nsponsored and employment-based preference categories under INA 203(a)-\n(b), 8 U.S.C. 1153(a)-(b), respectively, are allocated, and requires \nthat visas in these categories be made available in the order in which \nthe associated petition is filed.\n    INA 202(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. 1152(a)(2), imposes a ``per country'' limit \nof seven (7) percent of the total number of available family-sponsored \nand employment-based preference immigrant visas each fiscal year to \nnationals of individual foreign states. If the Department determines \nthat preference visa issuances to nationals of a particular country \nwill exceed the per-country limit, that country is identified in the \nVisa Bulletin as ``oversubscribed'' and INA 202(e), 8 U.S.C. 1152(e), \nrequires that visas in each preference category must be pro-rated to \nensure distribution across all preference categories. Individual \nfamily-sponsored and employment-based preference categories are also \ndeemed ``oversubscribed'' when worldwide demand exceeds the number of \nimmigrant visas available in those categories. Final action dates are \nlisted in the Visa Bulletin when countries and visa categories are \noversubscribed, and immigrant visas in categories with final action \ndates are available only to applicants with priority dates earlier than \nthe listed final action date.\n    The EB-4 category consists of special immigrants as defined in the \nINA, including certain religious workers, certain current and former \nU.S. Government employees abroad, certain officers and employees of \ninternational organizations, and certain special\n\n[[Page 18253]]\n\nimmigrant juveniles (SIJs). See sections 203(b)(4) and 101(a)(27) of \nthe INA, 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(4), 1101(a)(27).\n\nII. Discussion of the Change Reflected in the April 2023 Visa Bulletin\n\n    The Department seeks to clarify that the INA permits prorated \nallocation of available visas within an employment-based preference \ncategory to nationals from an individual country only when family-\nsponsored and employment-based preference visa demand from that country \nwill exceed its per-country limit under INA section 202(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. \n1152(a)(2). Consistent with this interpretation, the Department is no \nlonger assigning separate final action and filing dates for individuals \nchargeable to any of the NCA Countries in the EB-4 category and \nindividuals chargeable to these three countries are now subject to the \ndates in the column headed ``All Chargeability Areas Except Those \nListed'' (referred to herein as ``ROW,'' meaning the rest of the \nworld). The Department is required to make this change to bring \nDepartment practice, as reflected in the Visa Bulletin, into compliance \nwith these INA provisions. As a result of this change, there is no \nlonger a need for a separate column for the NCA Countries in the \nemployment-based preference ``Final Action Dates'' and ``Dates for \nFiling'' charts in the Visa Bulletin.\n    Specifically, INA 202(a), 8 U.S.C. 1152(a), makes clear that the \nper-country limit, which is implemented by setting final action dates \nfor a country in the Visa Bulletin, is triggered only when preference \nimmigrant visa demand from a country will exceed seven percent of the \ntotal number of preference visas made available in INA section 203(a)-\n(b), 8 U.S.C. 1153(a)-(b); that is, seven percent of the total number \navailable for all family-sponsored and employment-based preference \nimmigrant visas available worldwide.\n    This change corrects misapplication of the law in prior Visa \nBulletins, beginning with the May 2016 Visa Bulletin, which added a \nseparate column to the ``Final Action Dates for Employment-Based \nPreference Cases'' table, showing that EB-4 applicants chargeable to \nthe NCA Countries were assigned an EB-4 final action date separate from \nthe ROW column and these three countries were listed as \n``oversubscribed'' and subject to the pro-rating provision at INA \n202(e)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1152(e)(3). The May 2016 Visa Bulletin explained \nthat ``extremely high demand'' in the EB-4 category (including the EB-4 \nsubcategory for Certain Religious Workers (SR)) for applicants from the \nNCA Countries required implementation of final action dates in the EB-4 \ncategory for these countries. EB-4 final action dates were thus \nestablished for these three countries since May 2016 based on their \nhigh demand for EB-4 visas. The same approach was reflected in \nsubsequent Visa Bulletins and in the corresponding table with ``Dates \nfor Filing of Employment-Based Visa Applications,'' beginning with the \nOctober 2017 Visa Bulletin. However, that contravenes the Department's \ncurrent interpretation of the statutory prerequisite for when a country \ncan be deemed oversubscribed and allocation of preference visas can be \npro-rated: that the INA provision on pro-rating is based on a country's \ndemand for more than seven percent of all preference visas, not one \nsubcategory.\n    As none of the NCA Countries are expected to exceed the per-country \nlimit under INA 202(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. 1152(a)(2), there is no basis under \nthe INA to set final action dates and dates for filing for employment-\nbased preference visas that are specific to those countries.\n\nJulie Stufft,\nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services, Bureau of Consular \nAffairs, Department of State.\n[FR Doc. 2023-06252 Filed 3-27-23; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4710-06-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>",

    "supplementary_information": "The Department of State published a notice \nof proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for subpart A of 22 CFR part 62 in the \nFederal Register on September 22, 2009 (74 FR 48177). Subpart A sets \nforth the general provisions for eligibility and continuing \nrequirements for all designated sponsors that conduct exchange visitor \nprograms. After considering the comments that more than 100 parties \nsubmitted in response to the NPRM, the Department of State published a \nfinal rule on October 6, 2014 (79 FR 60294), at which time it requested \nadditional comments (2014 final rule).\n    The sponsor community has long sought the ability to digitally sign \nand electronically transmit (e.g., via email) Forms DS-2019, i.e., the \nStudent and Exchange Visitor Information System- (SEVIS-) generated \ndocuments that prospective exchange visitors and their spouses and \ndependents, if any, must present at U.S. embassies or consulates to \napply for J-visas. This Interim Final Rule permits sponsors to sign \nForms DS-2019 using digital signatures, defined as follows: An \napplication of technology for cryptographically derived signatures that \nensures meaningful authentication of the identity of the signer and \nintegrity of the document. Digital signatures are a subset of \nelectronic signatures, but unlike other electronic signatures, digital \nsignatures employ cryptography, i.e., are backed by a process such as a \npublic key infrastructure. Commonly used digital signature software \npackages include, but are not limited to, DocuSign, Adobe Sign, and \nGlobal Sign. For sponsors that are unable or do not wish to apply \ndigital signatures, the Interim Final Rule retains the current option \nof printing and hand signing Forms DS-2019 in ink.\n    With the implementation of this rule, sponsors may transmit Forms \nDS-2019 electronically, including directly to exchange visitors. \nSponsors without digital signature capacity may print and sign forms in \nink (as they do now, except that blue ink is no longer required), scan \nthe forms (e.g., into portable document format (PDF) files), and then \ntransmit them electronically. The Department of State notes that these \nregulatory changes will have no impact on SEVIS functionality or the \nnumber of Forms DS-2019 allotted to sponsors.\n    The Department of State believes that many sponsors already have \ndigital signature software, and that the elimination of the requirement \nthat sponsors mail paper forms worldwide will result in significant \ncost-savings. Accordingly, it anticipates that most sponsors will \nrecognize the benefits of digital signatures and, if they have not \nalready done so, will invest in digital signature software.\n    In this interim final rule, the Department of State also clarifies, \ncorrects, and/or deletes ambiguous, obsolete, or technically inaccurate \nlanguage and requirements, some of which were adopted before SEVIS-\ngenerated Forms DS-2019 replaced paper Forms IAP-66. The following two \nchanges are also made by this rulemaking: adoption of the plural forms \nof nouns (e.g., sponsors, exchange visitors); and replacement of the \nterm ``original'' with the term ``paper'' when describing the physical \nForms DS-2019.\n    The reasons for the regulatory changes, including comments about \nsuch changes, follow for each provision of 22 CFR 62.12 that the \nDepartment of State modifies herein. The following bolded citations \nrepresent current regulatory text in 22 CFR part 62.\n\n22 CFR 62.12(a) Issuance of Forms DS-2019\n\n    22 CFR 62.12(a)(1). The Department of State adds the language ``to \nSEVIS'' to clarify that it is access to SEVIS that is restricted to \nResponsible Officers and Alternate Responsible Officers (collectively, \nOfficers).\n    22 CFR 62.12(a)(3). The Department of State incorporates into this \nparagraph the requirement that sponsors may issue Forms DS-2019 for the \nenumerated purposes only if the regulations permit, and if necessary, \nthe Department of State authorizes the action. This change updates this \nspecific regulatory language to clarify requirements for sponsors.\n    22 CFR 62.12(a)(3)(ii). The Department of State eliminates the \nphrase ``when permitted by the regulations and authorized by the \nDepartment of State'' because these general requirements are now \npresent in 22 CFR 62.12(a)(3).\n    22 CFR 62.12(a)(3)(iii). For the same reason, the Department of \nState eliminates the phrase ``when permitted by the regulations and/or \nauthorized in writing by the Department of State.''\n    22 CFR 62.12(a)(3)(iv). The Department of State makes no changes to \nthis paragraph. The Department of State confirms the need to use the \nreprint function in SEVIS when replacing Forms DS-2019 that have been \nlost, stolen, or damaged. When nonimmigrants traveling on J-visas lose \ntheir Forms DS-2019, sponsors historically would reprint the previously \nissued forms and send them to the exchange visitors who requested a \ncopy. With electronic transmission,\n\n[[Page 18250]]\n\nsponsors should still use the reprint function in SEVIS to \nappropriately record the action before electronically transmitting \nreplacement forms to exchange visitors.\n    22 CFR 62.12(a)(3)(v). Commenting parties opined that re-entry into \nthe United States is not a reason that sponsors initially issue Forms \nDS-2019. The Department of State notes, however, there are instances \nwhen all travel signature lines on Forms DS-2019 are filled, and \nOfficers must issue new forms. Accordingly, the Department of State \nretains this provision.\n    22 CFR 62.12(a)(3)(vi). The Department of State eliminates the \nphrase ``when requested in SEVIS and authorized by the Department of \nState.'' The phrase ``when requested in SEVIS'' describes the method of \nrequesting category changes and is unnecessary in a rule that \nenumerates the reasons for issuing Forms DS-2019.\n    22 CFR 62.12(a)(3)(vii). The Department of State eliminates the \nphrase ``or a change in actual and current U.S. address'' in response \nto numerous comments that explained that this was not a valid example \nof reasons to issue Forms DS-2019 since this SEVIS field is not printed \non Forms DS-2019.\n\n22 CFR 62.12(b) Verification\n\n    22 CFR 62.1(b)(2)(ii). The Department of State eliminates the \nrequirement that Officers sign paper Forms DS-2019 using only blue ink \nto permit greater flexibility for sponsors.\n    22 CFR 62.12(b)(2)(iii). In response to numerous requests from \nsponsors to be able to sign Forms DS-2019 electronically, the \nDepartment of State adds a new paragraph to permit digital signatures, \ndefined as an application of technology for cryptographically derived \nsignatures that ensures meaningful authentication of the identity of \nthe signer and integrity of the document. Digital signatures are a \nsubset of electronic signatures, but unlike other electronic \nsignatures, digital signatures employ cryptography, i.e., are backed by \na process such as a public key infrastructure. Sponsors may also \ncontinue to sign paper Forms DS-2019 forms in ink. The Department \nremoves the requirement that the DS-2019 be signed in blue ink to allow \ngreater flexibility for sponsors. The Department of State also \nrecommends that sponsors remind applicants and their accompanying \nspouses and dependents, if any, that they must take a paper form to \ntheir visa interviews to be stamped and signed by a consular officer. \nThey must also present a paper copy of their Forms DS-2019 at their \nports of entry into the United States.\n    Several commenting parties also sought the flexibility to allow any \nOfficer to sign Forms DS-2019 that they submit via batch processing, \nwhen Officers whose names were printed on forms are not present to sign \npaper forms. However, when Officers print or reprint Forms DS-2019, \nSEVIS automatically populates Field #7 with the name of the Officer who \ninitially submitted the action, making it necessary for that Officer to \nsign the paper form. In the electronic environment, digital signatures \nare embedded in documents, allowing Officers to sign forms as they \ncreate them, thereby mitigating this concern.\n    Several commenting parties also asked whether different Officers \ncould sign Forms DS-2019 when they are reprinted for travel purposes. \nAs noted above, SEVIS prints in Field #7 the name of the Officer who \ninitiated the print/reprint function. Since a signature must match the \nname of the Officer printed on each form, sponsors should ensure that \nOfficers whose names appear on forms are available to sign them. The \nOfficer that signs the original Form DS-2019 may be different than the \nOfficer that reprints the form from SEVIS. The Department of State will \nexplore the capability of enhancing SEVIS to allow users to select the \nnames of Officers that will print on forms.\n\n22 CFR 62.12(c) Distribution of Forms DS-2019\n\n    The Department of State changes the heading of paragraph (c) to \n``Transmission of Forms DS-2019'' and clarifies to whom sponsors may \ntransmit Forms DS-2019. Many commenting parties read the current \nregulatory language to limit sponsors' transmission of Forms DS-2019 to \nonly ``authorized parties,'' meaning the Department of State and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Many commenters requested the \nDepartment of State expand the definition of ``authorized parties.'' To \nclarify this provision, the Department of State now specifically \nenumerates the parties to whom sponsors may transmit Forms DS-2019 \nelectronically (e.g., via email) or by mail (e.g., via postal or \ndelivery service): exchange visitors; accompanying spouses and \ndependents; legal guardians of minor exchange visitors; sponsor staff; \nFulbright commissions and their staff; and Federal, State, and local \ngovernment agencies or departments. The Fulbright commissions (and \ntheir staff) referenced above are authorized and established pursuant \nto section 103 of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of \n1961 (commonly known as the Fulbright-Hays Act) (22 U.S.C. 2453). The \nDepartment of State notes that sponsors' Officers must ensure that \nForms DS-2019 are secured; and they may transmit them electronically to \nother sponsor staff only on a shared network.\n    The Department of State clarifies that sponsors may continue to \ntransmit paper Forms DS-2019 via mail to foreign third parties acting \non their behalf to facilitate their gathering necessary paperwork for \nmultiple applicants to take to their visa interviews. Sponsors may not \ntransmit Forms DS-2019 electronically to foreign third parties, \nhowever, as the ability to transmit forms electronically to the parties \nenumerated above eliminates the need for foreign third parties to have \naccess to electronic forms.\n\n22 CFR 62.12(d) Allotment Requests\n\n    The Department of State makes case corrections and clarifying edits \nin this paragraph. It also eliminates the language establishing four \nweeks as the estimated time for responding to allotment requests since \nconditions outside the control of the Department of State may delay \nmeeting any specific deadline. It also clarifies that sponsors should \nrefer to the most recent version of the User Manual for Exchange \nVisitor Program Sponsor Users (RO/ARO) of SEVIS Volume I, Forms DS-3036 \nand DS-3037 on the <a href=\"http://j1visa.state.gov\">j1visa.state.gov</a> website to determine whether the \nDepartment of State has modified or updated the ``other information'' \nthat the regulation states it may require. Otherwise, it maintains the \ncurrent regulatory language.\n\n22 CFR 62.12(e) Safeguards and Controls\n\n    22 CFR 62.12(e)(1). The Department of State replaces the term \n``SEVIS logon identification Numbers (IDs)'' with the technically \naccurate term ``SEVIS User Names.''\n    22 CFR 62.12(e)(2). The Department of State modifies this section \nto prohibit transmission of Forms DS-2019 to any parties other than \nthose listed in paragraph (c).\n    22 CFR 62.12(e)(3). The Department of State adds the word \n``damaged'' to be consistent with 22 CFR 62.12(a)(3)(iv). It reminds \nsponsors to use the reprint function in SEVIS to sign and transmit \nreprinted Forms DS-2019.\n    22 CFR 62.12(e)(4). The Department of State makes no changes to \nthis section.\n\n[[Page 18251]]\n\nRegulatory Analysis and Notices\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department of State is issuing this rulemaking as an interim \nfinal rule for the following reasons. In the 2014 rulemaking, the \nDepartment of State stated its view that the Exchange Visitor Program \nis a foreign affairs function of the U.S. Government and that rules \nimplementing this function are exempt from sections 553 (Rulemaking) \nand 554 (Adjudications) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). It \nalso asserts that this rulemaking is exempt from notice and comment for \ntwo separate reasons. First, the rule responds to relevant comments \nsubmitted in response to the 2014 final rule, and as such, is a logical \noutgrowth of the 2014 final rule. The changes included in this \nrulemaking constitute rules of ``agency organization, procedure, or \npractice'' (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A)). Also, the Department of State has \n``good cause'' to find that notice and comment is ``impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest'' (5 U.S.C. \n553(b)(3)(B)). In the 2014 Final Rule, the Department of State sought \ncomments on 22 CFR 62.12, the control of Forms DS-2019. This interim \nfinal rule responds to those commenters and adopts some changes that \nwere recommended at that time. With respect to the procedural rule \nexception (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A)), the Department is expanding options \nfor signing and transmitting Forms DS-2019, without eliminating the \ncurrent method. Although there may be de minimis costs for sponsors to \nobtain digital signature software to avail themselves of the new \ndigital signature provision (if they choose to do so), those sponsors \nwho elect to continue the current procedure will not incur that cost. \nAccordingly, the Department of State believes that additional prior \nnotice and public comment on this provision are not necessary.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    This regulation is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804. \nThis rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant \nadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, \ninnovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based companies to compete with \nforeign-based companies in domestic and export markets.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This regulation will not result in the expenditure by State, local \nor Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of \n$100 million in any year, and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 \nU.S.C. 1501 et seq.).\n\nExecutive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department of State has determined that this regulation will \nnot have Tribal implications; will not impose substantial direct \ncompliance costs on Indian Tribal governments; and will not preempt \nTribal law. Accordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act: Small Business Impacts\n\n    Since this rule is exempt from section 553 (Rulemaking) and section \n554 (Adjudications) of the APA, this rule is not subject to the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (1980)).\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563\n\n    The Department of State has submitted this rule to the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, pursuant to its longstanding \npractice.\\1\\ The Department of State certifies that the benefits of \nthis rulemaking outweigh any costs, since sponsors and exchange \nvisitors will more likely experience cost savings from the options \npresented herein, and sponsors have in fact requested the changes. The \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs has designated this rule \nas non-significant, as defined by Executive Order 12866.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Pursuant to letters exchanged between the Department of \nState Legal Adviser and the Administrator of OIRA shortly after E.O. \n12866 was signed, the Department of State is generally exempt from \nthe provisions of E.O. 12866, except when it is promulgating \nregulations in conjunction with a domestic agency; provided that \nOIRA may review any significant regulatory actions of which it \nbecomes aware.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExecutive Order 12988\n\n    The Department of State has reviewed this rulemaking considering \nsections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate \nambiguity, minimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and \nreduce burdens.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132--Federalism\n\n    The Department of State finds that this regulation does not have \nsufficient federalism implications to require consultations or warrant \nthe preparation of a federalism summary impact statement.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rulemaking does not create or modify any information \ncollection that is subject to 44 U.S.C. chapter 35.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 62\n\n    Cultural exchange programs; Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department of State \namends 22 CFR part 62 as follows:\n\nPART 62--EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAM\n\n0\n1. The authority citation to 22 CFR part 62 continues to read as \nfollows:\n\n    Authority:  8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J), 1182, 1184, 1258; 22 U.S.C. \n1431 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.; 22 U.S.C. 2651a; 22 U.S.C. \n6531-6553; Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977, 42 FR 62461, 3 CFR, \n1977 Comp. p. 200; E.O. 12048, 43 FR 13361, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. \n168; 8 U.S.C. 1372; section 416 of Pub. L. 107-56, 115 Stat. 354 (8 \nU.S.C. 1372 note); and 8 U.S.C. 1761-1762.\n\n\n0\n2. Revise Sec.  62.12 to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  62.12  Control of Forms DS-2019.\n\n    (a) Issuance of Forms DS-2019. Sponsors must:\n    (1) Grant access to SEVIS only to Responsible Officers and \nAlternate Responsible Officers and ensure that they have access to and \nuse SEVIS to update required information;\n    (2) Ensure that Responsible Officers and Alternate Responsible \nOfficers input into SEVIS accurate, current, and updated information in \naccordance with these regulations; and\n    (3) Issue Forms DS-2019 only for the following purposes if \npermitted by the regulations and, as necessary, authorized by the \nDepartment of State:\n    (i) To facilitate the initial entry of exchange visitors and \naccompanying spouses and dependents, if any, into the United States;\n    (ii) To extend the duration of participation of exchange visitors;\n    (iii) To facilitate program transfers;\n    (iv) To replace lost, stolen, or damaged Forms DS-2019;\n    (v) To facilitate the re-entry into the United States of exchange \nvisitors and accompanying spouses and dependents, if any, who travel \noutside the United States during exchange visitors' programs;\n    (vi) To facilitate changes of category;\n    (vii) To update information when significant changes take place in \nregard to exchange visitors' programs (e.g., substantial changes in \nfunding, change in primary sites of activity, or changes in actual and \ncurrent U.S. address);\n    (viii) To facilitate the correction of a minor or technical \ninfraction; or\n\n[[Page 18252]]\n\n    (ix) To facilitate a ``reinstatement'' or a ``reinstatement update \nSEVIS status.\n    (b) Verification. (1) Prior to issuing Forms DS-2019, sponsors must \nverify that prospective exchange visitors:\n    (i) Are eligible and qualified for, and accepted into, the programs \nin which they will participate;\n    (ii) Possess adequate financial resources to participate in and \ncomplete their exchange visitor programs; and\n    (iii) Possess adequate financial resources to support accompanying \nspouses and dependents, if any.\n    (2) Sponsors must ensure that:\n    (i) Only Responsible Officers or Alternate Responsible Officers who \nare physically present in the United States or in a U.S. territory may \nprint and/or sign Forms DS-2019;\n    (ii) Only Responsible Officers or Alternate Responsible Officers \nwhose names are printed on Forms DS-2019 are permitted to sign the \nforms; and\n    (iii) Responsible Officers or Alternate Responsible Officers sign \npaper Forms DS-2019 in ink or sign Forms DS-2019 using digital \nsignatures.\n    (c) Transmission of Forms DS-2019. Sponsors may transmit Forms DS-\n2019 either electronically (e.g., via email) or by mailing them (e.g., \nvia postal or delivery service) to only the following individuals or \nentities: exchange visitors; accompanying spouses and dependents, if \nany; legal guardians of minor exchange visitors; sponsor staff; \nFulbright Commissions and their staff; and Federal, State, or local \ngovernment agencies or departments. In addition, sponsors may mail \nsigned paper Forms DS-2019 via postal or delivery service to foreign \nthird parties acting on their behalf for distribution to prospective \nexchange visitors.\n    (d) Allotment requests--(1) Annual Form DS-2019 allotment. Sponsors \nmust submit an electronic request via SEVIS to the Department of State \nfor an annual allotment of Forms DS-2019 based on the annual reporting \ncycle (e.g., academic, calendar, or fiscal year) stated in their letter \nof designation or redesignation. The Department of State has sole \ndiscretion to determine the number of Forms DS-2019 it will issue to \nsponsors.\n    (2) Expansion of program.

    "supplementary_information": "I. What changes to 22 CFR 42.68 does the Department propose?\n\n    The Department proposes eliminating 22 CFR 42.68 in its entirety. \nUnder 22 CFR 42.68 consular officers may, in certain circumstances, \narrange for an informal evaluation of the family members of an \nimmigrant visa applicant. Specifically, if a principal immigrant visa \napplicant will precede the family members in traveling to the United \nStates, 22 CFR 42.68 allows a consular officer to arrange for an \ninformal examination of the family members to make a preliminary \ndetermination of any ground of ineligibility on their part to receive a \nvisa. Under the current regulation, the principal applicant must be \ninformed of any preliminary finding of ineligibility, and a \ndetermination in connection with an informal examination carries no \nassurance that the individual will be eligible for an immigrant visa in \nthe future.\n\nII. Why is the Department proposing this rule?\n\nA. Increasing Complexity in Evaluating Immigrant Visa Applicants Makes \nInformal Evaluation an Inappropriate Use of Resources\n\n    The regulation, 22 CFR 42.68, was among the regulations promulgated \nby the Department in 1952 after the enactment of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. Since 1952, however, the immigrant visa process \ngenerally and the scope of grounds on which an applicant may be \nineligible for an immigrant visa has grown increasingly more complex, \nrendering the concept of an informal evaluation as outdated and \nimpractical for a consular officer to complete with accuracy.\n    In 1952, a noncitizen wishing to immigrate completed Form FS-256a, \nand a consular officer then assessed their eligibility during an \ninterview. This simple form requested basic biographical information \nand included a statement affirming that the noncitizen was not \ninadmissible. Since 1952, Congress has enacted numerous laws imposing \nnew immigration ineligibilities.\\1\\ Today, a noncitizen applying for an \nimmigrant visa completes form DS-260, submits biometrics and supporting \ndocuments, including police certificates and the results of a medical \nexamination, and the consular officer interviews the applicant and vets \nthe applicant through a series of electronic national security and \ncriminal vetting systems to identify potential grounds of \nineligibility.\\2\\ The results of these vetting measures are one of the \ncentral factors upon which a consular officer relies to determine \nwhether the applicant is ineligible for a visa. Without a complete \napplication for a visa with the required supporting documents, the \nDepartment lacks sufficient information for a thorough assessment of \npotential ineligibilities that would make an informal evaluation \nuseful.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See, for example, the Immigration Reform and Control Act \n(IRCA) (100 Stat. 3359); the 1990 Immigration Act (104 Stat. 4978); \nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n(IIRIRA) (110 Stat. 3009).\n    \\2\\ Consistent with the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \nReform Act (EBSVERA) (116 Stat. 543).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The informal evaluation that was created in 1952 does not provide a \ncomplete picture of an individual's\n\n[[Page 16385]]\n\neligibility for a visa. Evolving national security priorities, \nparticularly since September 11, 2001, have resulted in significant \nmodifications to the visa screening enterprise. The current enterprise \nincludes numerous concurrent interagency reviews for potential \nderogatory information of both principal and derivative immigrant visa \napplicants. Given the broad range of potential ineligibilities, and the \nlayered vetting processes in which applicants are reviewed, a consular \nofficer cannot at the time of the informal evaluation make an accurate \nassessment as to the noncitizen's eligibility for a visa and \nconsequently cannot fully advise a principal applicant on the \neligibility of their family members.\n    If the Department were to update the informal evaluation process to \nprovide a more informed and thorough review of a principal applicant's \nfamily members, such that a consular officer could provide an accurate \npreliminary assessment of visa eligibility, such changes would require \nreallocation of already limited resources of both the Department and \nother agencies to review applicants who have not--and potentially will \nnot--apply for a visa, potentially requiring significant changes to \nDepartment systems that facilitate vetting of applicants based only on \ntheir submission of a completed visa application. Moreover, even with a \ncomprehensive slate of information regarding a visa applicant, an \nassessment of eligibility can only account for their potential \neligibility at that time, and is not a reliable indicator of whether \nthey would be eligible in the future if and when they submit a visa \napplication. Consequently, an informal evaluation is an inefficient use \nof State resources, and an unreliable tool for prospective applicants.\n    The authority provided for in 22 CFR 42.68 has not been used in \nrecent years. Given the difficulty in accurately predicting an \napplicant's visa eligibility through an informal process, the \nDepartment is unable to allocate its limited resources toward offering \na service that has been rendered obsolete.\n\nB. Current Application of 22 CFR 42.68\n\n    To determine whether and how often the informal evaluation \nauthority has been used, the Visa Office consulted with management in \nthe immigrant visa units of five of the largest-volume immigrant visa \nprocessing posts: Ciudad Juarez, Manila, Santo Domingo, Mumbai, and \nDhaka. Each of the five posts reported they have no record of ever \nproviding this service. Given that these five posts process 32 percent \nof the immigrant visas worldwide, and they have no recent information \nregarding this service, we are confident that eliminating this service \nwill not cause undue hardship to applicants or result in significant \nimpacts to applicants.\n    In light of the complexity required to evaluate a noncitizen's \neligibility for an immigrant visa, and limited resources to reliably \nassess eligibility absent a visa application, the Department seeks to \neliminate this regulation.\n\nIII. Regulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    This proposed rule involves the Department amending visa policy, \nwhich is a foreign affairs function of the United States and, \ntherefore, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1), would be exempt from \nthe notice and comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553. Notwithstanding \nthe applicability of the foreign affairs exception to this rule, the \nDepartment is providing 60 days for public comment on this proposed \nrule's elimination of 22 CFR 42.68.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272 (Small Business)\n\n    As this rulemaking is not required to be published for notice and \ncomment under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the regulatory \nflexibility analysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Nonetheless, the Department \ncertifies that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UFMA), \nPub. L. 104-4, 109 Stat. 48, 2 U.S.C. 1532, generally requires agencies \nto prepare a statement before proposing any rule that may result in an \nannual expenditure of $100 million or more by State, local, or tribal \ngovernments, or by the private section. This proposed rule will not \nresult in any such expenditure, nor will it significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)\n\n    Executive Orders (E.O.) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess \nthe costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public \nhealth and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). The \nDepartment reviewed this proposal to ensure consistency with those \nrequirements. OMB reviewed this proposed rule and designated as a \n``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of E.O. 12866. \nAccordingly, OMB has reviewed this proposed regulation.\n    As noted above, the Visa Office consulted with management in the \nimmigrant visa units of five of the largest-volume immigrant visa \nprocessing posts: Ciudad Juarez, Manila, Santo Domingo, Mumbai, and \nDhaka. Each of the five posts reported they do not provide this \nservice. Given that these five posts process 32 percent of the \nimmigrant visas worldwide, and they have no information regarding the \nprovision of this service, we are confident that eliminating this \nregulation will not result in significant impacts.\n    The Department has also considered this proposed rule in light of \nExecutive Order 13563 and affirms that this proposed rule is consistent \nwith the guidance therein.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132 (Federalism)\n\n    This proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Nor will the proposed rule have \nfederalism implications warranting the application of Executive Orders \nNo. 12372 and No. 13132.\n\nExecutive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform)\n\n    The Department has reviewed the proposed rule in light of sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburden.\n\nExecutive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments)\n\n    The Department has determined that this proposed rule will not have \nTribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian Tribal governments, and will not pre-empt Tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to \nthis proposal.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This proposed rule does not impose any new reporting or \nrecordkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 \nU.S.C. chapter 35.\n\n[[Page 16386]]\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Immigration, Passports and visas.\n\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department proposes to \namend 22 CFR part 42 as follows:\n\nPART 42--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION \nAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.

    "supplementary_information": "What changes is the Department making?\n\n    This rule clarifies that immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants \nmay upload digital photographs electronically as part of the online \nvisa application process in lieu of submitting ink-signed photographs. \nThe electronic signature on the DS-160, Online Nonimmigrant Visa \nApplication, or the biometric signature for the DS-260, Online \nApplication for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, pursuant to 22 \nCFR 41.103(a) or 42.67(a)(3) respectively, shall be considered as \nsigning the digital photograph and any paper photographs that may be \notherwise submitted. Additionally, this rule amends the language \nconcerning the nonimmigrant photograph to clarify that the submitted \nphotograph must meet the specifications prescribed by the Department \nand deletes language allowing immigrant visa applicants to submit black \nand white photographs.\n\nWhy is the Department promulgating this rule?\n\n    Section 221(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \n1201(b), states that ``[e]ach alien who applies for a visa shall be \nregistered in connection with his application, and shall furnish copies \nof his photograph signed by him for such use as may be by regulations \nrequired.'' 22 CFR 41.103(a)(1) requires every noncitizen seeking a \nnonimmigrant visa to make an electronic application on Form DS-160, the \nOnline Nonimmigrant Visa Application, or, as directed by a consular \nofficer, an application on Form DS-156, Nonimmigrant Visa Application. \nApplicants must sign the Form DS-160 electronically by clicking the box \ndesignated ``Sign Application'' in the certification section of the \napplication. The Form DS-160 is the electronic version of the \nnonimmigrant visa application, while the Form DS-156 is the paper-based \nnonimmigrant visa application and can only be used in limited \ncircumstances.\n\n[[Page 13695]]\n\n    Generally, immigrant visa applicants must make an electronic \napplication on Form DS-260, the Online Application for Immigrant Visa \nand Alien Registration, or, as directed by the consular officer, an \napplication on Form DS-230, Application for Immigrant Visa or Alien \nRegistration. Applicants must sign the Form DS-260 electronically by \nclicking the box designated ``Sign Application'' in the certification \nsection of the application. Additionally, an immigrant visa applicant \nsubmitting a Form DS-260 is required at the time of the interview to \nswear to or affirm the application and biometrically sign the \napplication.\n    The purpose of this rule is to remove an outdated sentence from 22 \nCFR 41.105(a)(3), which requires nonimmigrant visa applicants to ``sign \n(full name) on the reverse side of the photographs'' and to clarify \nthat electronic and/or biometric signature of the appropriate visa \napplication is deemed the signature on all submitted photographs, \neither digitally or on paper. In the late 1990s, the Department began \nthe modernization of its visa adjudication and issuance systems and \nprocedures. Part of that initiative involved digitizing the photograph \ncollection process. During this time, the consular officers began to \nscan the paper photographs provided by nonimmigrant visa applicants and \nreturn the photographs to the applicant, using the scanned copy for all \nadjudication and recordkeeping purposes. In 2010, the Department \nannounced that it would be transitioning from a paper-based application \nprocess to an electronic/online application process. As a part of this \ntransition, the Department also transitioned to a combination of \nelectronic signature (``click and submit'' signature) and biometric \nsignature as well as online digital photograph collection. The digital \nphotograph was rolled out slowly, with some posts adopting digital \nphotograph collection simultaneously with the online application, while \nsome posts delayed the digital photograph collection until their \napplicant pool adjusted to the online application procedure. As of \n2021, nearly all posts use the digital photo collection tool as part of \nthe online nonimmigrant visa application process. Digital photo \ncollection reduces administrative burdens on consular posts, which \notherwise would have to scan physical photographs for hundreds to \nthousands of visa applicants each day, and on applicants who no longer \nneed to provide physical copies of their photographs. In cases where an \napplicant is unable to upload a photo that meets the specific \nrequirements, the applicant may submit a printed photo to the U.S. \nembassy or consulate where they are applying for a visa. Under the \nModernized Immigrant Visa (MIV) processing, applicants can upload a \nphotograph as part of the required documentation along with the DS-260. \nFor non-MIV paper-based immigrant visa cases, applicants may still \nbring a paper photograph at the time of interview which is then scanned \nand uploaded. Immigrant visa applicants may also be required to supply \nadditional photographs at the time of their interview; those \nphotographs may be included in the paper-based immigrant visa packet \nthat the individual carries with them when they travel to the United \nStates. The applicants then hand the completed packets to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. MIV cases do not require paper packets \nand are digitally processed.\n    Under existing Department practice, submission of a digital \nphotograph along with an online visa application that the applicant \nsigns electronically or biometrically is sufficient to meet the \nrequirement of furnishing signed photographs under INA section 221(b), \n8 U.S.C. 1201(b). This rule would not change current practice, but only \nclarify the regulation to reflect this option.\n    Additionally, the Department is revising the immigrant and \nnonimmigrant visa photograph rules for consistency. Longstanding \npractice for digital and paper photographs is consistent for both \nimmigrant and nonimmigrant applicants but regulations are inconsistent \nas to technical requirements. To clarify this potential inconsistency \nand to ensure that the Department can readily collect photographs that \nreflect current best practices, the Department is revising nonimmigrant \nrequirements to be consistent with the immigrant requirements. The \nDepartment is also deleting from the immigrant visa photo rule language \nthat allowed for the submission of black and white photographs. That \nlanguage is outdated, and the Department is not aware of any country \nwhere the submission of color photographs is unavailable.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rule is issued without prior notice and comment pursuant to \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (``APA''), 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A), because \nit re-states existing agency procedure or practice. As noted in the \nPreamble, under existing Department practice, submission of a digital \nphotograph, along with an online visa application that the applicant \nsigns electronically, is already considered sufficient to meet the \nrequirement of furnishing signed photographs under INA section 221(b), \n8 U.S.C. 1201(b). The purpose of this rule is to align the regulatory \ntext with this existing Department practice and interpretation of 8 \nU.S.C. 1201(b). Therefore, the Department is issuing this amendment as \na final rule. In accordance with the APA, it is effective 30 days after \npublication.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    Because this final rule is exempt from notice and comment \nrulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the regulatory \nflexibility analysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and \ntribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 \nmillion or more in any year and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nCongressional Review Act of 1996\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2), for \npurposes of congressional review of agency rulemaking under the \nCongressional Review Act. At this time, the Department does not believe \nthat this rule will result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or adverse \neffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, \ninnovation, or the ability of U.S.-based companies to compete with \nforeign-based companies in domestic and import markets.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866, and 13563: Reducing Regulation and Controlling \nRegulatory Cost\n\n    The Department has reviewed this rule to ensure its consistency \nwith the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in Executive \nOrders 12866 and 13563, and has determined that the benefits of this \nregulation, i.e., updating these rules to account for modern \ntechnological advancements, outweigh any cost, which the Department \nassesses to be minimal.\n\n[[Page 13696]]\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132: Federalism\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. The rule will not have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nExecutive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not preempt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose or revise any reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 \nU.S.C. Chapter 35.\n\nList of Subjects\n\n22 CFR Part 41\n\n    Aliens, Employment, Foreign Officials, Immigration, Students, \nPassports and Visas.\n\n22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Aliens, Immigration and Visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, 22 CFR parts \n41 and 42 are amended as follows:\n\nPART 41--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF NONIMMIGRANTS UNDER THE \nIMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.

    "supplementary_information": "What changes to 22 CFR 41.111 does the Department propose?\n\n    This rule amends the regulation identifying categories of \nnonimmigrants who may be issued nonimmigrant visas in the United \nStates, by adding a limited category of nonimmigrants who are born in \nthe United States, but not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, as they \nwere born to certain nonimmigrants maintaining A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3, G-1, \nG-3, G-4, or NATO status and properly classifiable as such.\n    Prior to this amendment, the regulation identifying categories of \nnoncitizens authorized to obtain diplomatic nonimmigrant visas in the \nUnited States limited issuance to noncitizens ``currently maintaining \nstatus'' and ``properly classifiable'' in the A, C-2, C-3, G, or NATO \nnonimmigrant visa categories, and required that the noncitizens have \nevidence that they have ``been lawfully admitted in that status or \nhave, after admission, had their classification changed to that \nstatus'' and their ``period of authorized stay in the United Sates in \nthat status has not yet expired.'' 22 CFR 41.111(b)(1). The Department \nof State determines whether a noncitizen is maintaining A or G status, \nthe most common visa categories impacted for purposes of the present \nrule. (See e.g., 8 CFR 214.2(a)(1) and (g)(1), which provide that A and \nG nonimmigrants are admitted to the United States by the Department of \nHomeland Security for the ``duration of the period for which the alien \ncontinues to be recognized by the Secretary of State as being entitled \nto that status.'') Noncitizens previously admitted to the United States \nwho are seeking domestic visa issuance satisfy the requirement, set out \nin the amended regulation, that they have been ``admitted [to the \nUnited States] in [A, C, G, or NATO] status'' or have ``had their \nclassification changed to [A, C, G, or NATO] status'' by providing \ndocumentation from the Department of Homeland Security, such as an I-\n94.\n    Children born in the United States to parents maintaining certain A \nor G nonimmigrant status and benefiting\n\n[[Page 53374]]\n\nfrom diplomatic agent level immunities are not considered born subject \nto the jurisdiction of the United States and therefore do not acquire \nU.S. citizenship at birth under the Fourteenth Amendment. While not \ncommon, certain children born to parents in C-2, C-3 and NATO status \nalso may not acquire U.S. citizenship at birth. This limited group of \nchildren would therefore be present in the United States without any \ndocumentation of their A, C-2, C-3, G or NATO nonimmigrant status. The \nDepartment's policy is that such children should be issued \ndocumentation of their A, C-2, C-3, G or NATO nonimmigrant status, as \nprovided for by law for derivatives of the principal nonimmigrant. This \namendment will codify existing policy permitting diplomatic visa \nissuance in the United States to this limited group of children, whose \nparents and other family members already are covered by the regulation \ndescribing issuance of diplomatic visas in the United States. This \nprocedure is consistent with Department of State accreditation policy, \nwhich requires that derivative family members of those in A and G \nstatus possess a valid A or G visa.\n    In this rulemaking, the other categories of noncitizens eligible \nfor visa issuance in the United States remain unchanged.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nA. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rule is exempt from notice and comment as it involves a \nforeign affairs function of the United States. 5 U.S.C. 553(a).\n    An action will fall within the exception if it ``clearly and \ndirectly'' involves a foreign affairs function. Capital Area \nImmigrants' Rights Coal. v. Trump, 471 F. Supp. 3d 25, 53 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(``to be covered by the foreign affairs function exception, a rule must \nclearly and directly involve activities or actions characteristic to \nthe conduct of international relations''). Cases that directly involve \nthe conduct of foreign affairs include rules that regulate foreign \ndiplomats in the United States. E.B. et al. v. Dep't of State, Civil \nAction 19-2856 at 11 (D.D.C. Feb. 4, 2022); CAIR v. Trump, 471 F. Supp. \n3d 25, 54 (D.D.C. 2020). For example, in City of N.Y. v. Permanent \nMission of India to the U.N., the Second Circuit found that a State \nDepartment Federal Register Notice regarding exemptions from real \nproperty taxes imposed by state and local governments validly invoked \nthe foreign affairs exemption because the regulation of \n``quintessential foreign affairs functions such as diplomatic relations \nand the regulation of foreign missions [. . .] clearly and directly \ninvolves a `foreign affairs function' '' City of N.Y. v. Permanent \nMission of India to the U.N., 618 F.3d 172, 202 (2d Cir. 2010).\n    This rule governs the issuance of visas to foreign diplomats and \ntheir family members in the United States and thus similarly implicates \nmatters of diplomacy directly. It also is about a matter that is likely \nto have significant reciprocal consequences for the treatment of U.S. \ndiplomatic personnel overseas. In the absence of a rule governing the \ndomestic issuance of visas to the children of foreign mission officials \nborn within the United States, the mission members may be required to \ntravel overseas and apply for a visa for their child before reentering \nthe United States to continue their assignment. These children may also \nface difficulties in traveling within the United States if they do not \npossess a valid visa. This rule regulates the treatment of foreign \nmissions to allow for regular diplomatic relations between countries, \nand directly invokes a foreign affairs function. Requiring foreign \nmission personnel and their children to travel overseas and apply for a \nnew diplomatic visa similarly invites reciprocal requirements on U.S. \ndiplomatic personnel, significantly affecting the ability of U.S. \ndiplomatic personnel to engage with foreign partners and conduct the \nwork of foreign relations if they must depart the host country to \nobtain a new visa for the child. The State Department is best \npositioned to make determinations about such matters of international \nreciprocity--a point acknowledged by several district courts to justify \nthe foreign affairs exception for rules such as this. See CAIR, 471 F. \nSupp. 3d at 54 (exempting such rules from notice and comment rulemaking \n``makes sense'' because ``in the diplomatic context, agency action may \nbe grounded in international reciprocity'').\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    Because this final rule is exempt from notice and comment \nrulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the regulatory \nflexibility analysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Nonetheless, the Department \ncertifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on \na substantial number of small entities.\n\nC. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1532, generally \nrequires agencies to prepare a statement before proposing any rule that \nmay result in an annual expenditure of $100 million or more by State, \nlocal, or Tribal governments, or by the private sector. This rule does \nnot require the Department to prepare a statement because it will not \nresult in any such expenditure, nor will it significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. This rule involves visas, which involve \nindividuals, and does not affect, state, local, or Tribal governments, \nor businesses.\n\nD. Congressional Review Act of 1996\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 804. This rule \nwill not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or \nmore; a major increase in costs or prices; or adverse effects on \ncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the \nability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign-based \ncompanies in domestic and import markets.\n\nE. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)\n\n    Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess costs \nand benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is \nnecessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits \n(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety \neffects, distributed impacts, and equity). These Executive Orders \nstress the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of \nreducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The \nDepartment has examined this rule in light of Executive Order 13563 and \nhas determined that the rulemaking is consistent with the guidance \ntherein. The Department has reviewed this rulemaking to ensure its \nconsistency with the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in \nExecutive Order 12866. This rule will ensure consistency with U.S. and \ninternational law, and the benefits of the clarity will benefit the \nforeign relations of the United States. There are no anticipated costs \nto the public associated with this rule. This rule has been forwarded \nto the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and has been \ndesignated not significant under Executive Order 12866.\n\n[[Page 53375]]\n\nF. Executive Orders 12372 and 13132\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effect on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Nor will the rule have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nG. Executive Order 12988\n\n    The Department has reviewed the rule considering sections 3(a) and \n3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, minimize \nlitigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce burden.\n\nH. Executive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \nTribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian Tribal governments, and will not pre-empt Tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nI. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 41\n\n    Aliens, Foreign officials, Immigration, Passports and Visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, 22 CFR part \n41 is amended to read as follows:\n\nPART 41--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF NONIMMIGRANTS UNDER THE \nIMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.

The IFR amended Department regulations at 22 CFR 42.33(b)(1) \nto require a Diversity Visa (``DV'') program entrant to provide on the \nelectronic DV entry form the unique serial or issuance number \nassociated with that entrant's valid, unexpired passport, as well as \nthe passport's country or authority of issuance, and its expiration \ndate, unless the entrant claimed a valid passport exemption pursuant to \n22 CFR 42.2(d), (e), or (g)(2).

A recent review of the Department's Cost of Service Model (CoSM) established that the costs associated with attempts to recover on non-viable instruments are now captured within the passport application fee.

    "supplementary_information": "Background\n\n    This rule makes changes to the Schedule of Fees in 22 CFR 22.1 by \nremoving Item Number 74, the $25 return check processing fee, from the \nSchedule of Fees. This fee was added to the Schedule in 1991 to recoup \nthe cost of time spent by passport office personnel attempting to \nrecover on bad checks applicants had submitted to the Department. \nAccording to the Passport Directorate's research, in FY 1989 there were \napproximately 8,800 bad checks and money orders, which required an \nestimated 5,400 staff hours to process. This fee has only been charged \ndomestically; overseas posts do not accept personal checks and have not \ncharged the fee. A recent review of the Department's CoSM established \nthat the costs associated with the return check processing fee are now \ncaptured within\n\n[[Page 16637]]\n\na portion of the passport application fee the Department already \ncharges.\n\nWhat is the authority for this action?\n\n    The Department of State's general authority to set and charge fees \nfor consular services it provides derives from the user charges \nstatute, 31 U.S.C. 9701. See, e.g., 31 U.S.C. 9701(b)(2)(A) (``The head \nof each agency . . . may prescribe regulations establishing the charge \nfor a service or thing of value provided by the agency . . . based on . \n. . the costs to the government.''). Various statutes permit the \nDepartment of State to retain some of the fee revenue it collects \n(e.g., passport security surcharge, immigrant visa security surcharge, \naffidavit of support, etc.), but the Department of State lacks \nstatutory authority to retain the return check processing fee. As with \nmany other consular fees, all collections of this fee must be deposited \ninto the general fund of the Treasury pursuant to the Miscellaneous \nReceipts Statute, 31 U.S.C. 3302(b). The Department likewise does not \nretain the passport application fee. See 22 U.S.C. 214(a) (``There \nshall be collected and paid into the Treasury of the United States a \nfee, prescribed by the Secretary of State by regulation, for the filing \nof each application for a passport . . . .'').\n\nActivity-Based Costing\n\n    To set fees in accordance with the general user charges principles \nset forth in 31 U.S.C. 9701, the Department must calculate the true \ncost to the U.S. government of providing each consular service. \nFollowing guidance provided in ``Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts \nand Standards for the Federal Government,'' OMB's Statement #4 of \nFederal Accounting Standards (SFFAS #4), available at <a href=\"http://www.fasab.gov/pdffiles/sffas-4.pdf\">http://www.fasab.gov/pdffiles/sffas-4.pdf</a>, the Department chose to develop its \nCoSM using an Activity-Based Costing (ABC) methodology to determine the \ntrue cost of each consular service.\n    The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines ABC as a ``set \nof accounting methods used to identify and describe costs and required \nresources for activities within processes.'' Organizations can use the \nsame staff and resources (computer equipment, production facilities, \netc.) to produce multiple products or services; therefore, ABC models \nseek to identify and assign costs to processes and activities and then \nto individual products and services through the identification of key \ncost drivers referred to as ``resource drivers'' and ``activity \ndrivers.'' The goal is to proportionally and accurately distribute \ncosts. ABC models require financial and accounting analysis and \nmodeling skills combined with a detailed understanding of an \norganization's business processes. SFFAS Statement #4 provides a \ndetailed discussion of the use of cost accounting by the U.S. \nGovernment.\n    The ABC approach focuses on the activities required to produce a \nparticular service or product and uses resource drivers to assign costs \nthrough activities and activity drivers to assign costs from activities \nto services. In the context of the work of the Department's Bureau of \nConsular Affairs (CA), resource drivers assign costs (resources \nincluding materials, supplies, and labor utilized in the production or \ndelivery of services and products) to activities using business rules \nthat reflect the operational reality of CA and the data available from \nconsular systems, surveys, and internal records. Most resource drivers \nare based on time spent on each activity. Activity drivers assign the \ncost of consular activities to the services CA provides. Most activity \ndrivers are based on volumes.\n\nWhy is the department removing this fee?\n\n    Based on feedback from CA/PPT's field offices, the Department \nevaluated whether there was a need to charge the $25 return check \nprocessing fee. Upon review, it was determined that the costs \nassociated with this service are now captured in the CoSM's cashiering \nactivity, which is accounted for in the passport application fee the \nDepartment already charges. The Department therefore no longer needs to \ncharge the return check processing fee in order to recover the costs of \nproviding this service.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    As removal of this fee constitutes a benefit, this rule is \npublished as a final rule under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). \nSince the rule is exempt from Sec.  553, this rule is effective upon \npublication.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    The Department has reviewed this rule and, by approving it, \ncertifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601(6).\n\nUnfunded Mandates Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not result in the expenditure by state, local, and \ntribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 \nmillion or more in any year, and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 \nU.S.C. 1501-1504.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    This rule is a not major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\n\nExecutive Order 12866\n\n    The Department has reviewed this rule to ensure its consistency \nwith the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in the \nExecutive Order and affirms that this regulation is consistent with the \nguidance therein. The Office of Management and Budget has designated \nthis rule not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.\n    Details of the changes to the Schedule of Fee are as follows:\n\n                                                        Table 1--Changes to the Schedule of Fees\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                   Projected      Estimated\n                                                                                                 annual number    change in     Change in     Change in\n               Item No.                 Proposed fee   Current fee    Change in    Percentage         of         annual fees      state      remittance\n                                                                         fee        increase     applications     collected     retained     to Treasury\n                                                                                                      \\1\\            \\2\\          fees\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         SCHEDULE OF FEES FOR CONSULAR SERVICES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n                                                                      * * * * * * *\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n                                                                      * * * * * * *\n                  PPT\n \n\n[[Page 16638]]\n\n \n                                                                      * * * * * * *\n74.

    "supplementary_information": "The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls \n(DDTC), U.S. Department of State, administers the International Traffic \nin Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120-130). The regulations, \ncodified as subchapter M of chapter I, title 22 of the Code of Federal \nRegulations (``the subchapter'') implement those authorities of the \nArms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) delegated to \nthe Secretary of State pursuant to Executive Order 13637. This rule \nrestructures part 120 of the ITAR to better organize the definitions \npreviously found in that part and other locations throughout the ITAR \nand to consolidate provisions that provide background information or \notherwise apply throughout the regulations. In addition, this rule adds \ntext not previously found in the ITAR and makes clarifying revisions to \nexisting text. This rule is intended to be the first in a series of \nrulemakings that will further streamline and clarify the subchapter. \nThe Department makes the following revisions to the ITAR in this \ninterim final rule:\n\nRevisions of General Application\n\n    Prior to this rulemaking, generally applicable information and \ndefinitions were spread throughout the subchapter. As a result of this \nrulemaking, part 120 is dividing into three subparts: Subpart A--\nGeneral Information; Subpart B--General Policies and Processes; and \nSubpart C--Definitions. The division into subparts is intended to \nprovide the reader with a roadmap for the regulations. Subpart A--\nGeneral Information, consolidates and explains the legislative \nauthority and purpose of the regulations to aid in understanding their \nimportance and source. Subpart B--General Policies and Processes, \noutlines the general processes and policies of the ITAR. Finally, \nSubpart C--Definitions, provides a consolidated list of defined terms \nthat are applicable throughout the ITAR. Part and section-specific \ninformation and definitions continue to be located in the applicable \npart or section of the regulations. DDTC notes that the definitions in \nsubpart C are not included in alphabetical order. DDTC endeavored to \ninclude definitions in a logical order so as to provide larger \nconceptual definitions first, to keep like concepts together, to nest \nrelated definitions in single sections, and to match the framework of \nthe regulations. DDTC believes that this structure outweighs any ease \nin finding a definition through the use of alphabetization, \nparticularly considering modern methods of electronic search. Finally, \nDDTC believes that the relatively limited number of defined terms \nwithin the subchapter makes this subpart manageable in this way.\n    DDTC is revising those sections affected by this rule that use \nacronyms to follow a standard format. Where a single term for which \nthere is a known acronym appears on more than two occasions within any \none section, the first instance is followed by a parenthetical \ncontaining the acronym and subsequent use of the term is by acronym. \nThis will provide consistency of format without sacrificing clarity and \nlimits unnecessary text.\n\nSection-Specific Revisions\n\n    The following descriptions explain non-editorial changes in text to \nsections in this rule. Further, when discussing amended text that also \ninvolves the movement of text to a new location or the creation of new \ntext modeled on existing language, the former or existing location is \nprovided. When discussing amended text below, citations are to the \nsection cites of this rule (i.e., the new location). When discussing \ntext that has been moved by this rule, the location of the text prior \nto this rule is referred to as its ``former'' location. When discussing \na section or text that is not moved by this rule, the location is \nreferred to as its ``existing'' location. The table at the conclusion \nof the preamble provides both the former and new ITAR citations for all \nrelocations of regulatory text at the section or sentence level for \nassistance in associating new citations with former citations. It also \nidentifies all existing (i.e., non-relocated) sections that have been \nrevised. This rule does not amend or relocate any ITAR provisions not \nincluded in the table below. In order to maintain focus on changes to \nthe text of the ITAR as it appeared prior to this rule and to the \naddition of new text to the subchapter and to minimize unnecessary \nexplanation, the following preamble text does not describe the new \nlocation of the text formerly located in the section cites discussed. \nPersons interested in the movement of sections should review the table \nat the end of this section.\n\nSection 120.1 General Authorities\n\n    Revising the section heading of existing Sec.  120.1 from ``General \nauthorities, receipt of licenses, and ineligibility'' to ``General \nAuthorities'' to reflect the revised focus of the section. Revising the \nintroductory paragraph of Sec.  120.1(a) to clarify the manner of \ndelegation by the Secretary of State to the Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof State for Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military \nAffairs of the authority to administer the ITAR.\n\nSection 120.2 Designation of Defense Articles and Defense Services\n\n    Revising the fifth sentence of existing Sec.  120.2 to include a \nlimitation to defense articles and defense services ``on the USML in \npart 121 of this subchapter'' in order to account for the delegation to \nthe Attorney General of the authority to designate defense articles and \nservices subject to control for permanent import by section 1(n)(ii) of \nExecutive Order 13637.\n\nSection 120.4 Commodity Jurisdiction\n\n    Revising existing Sec.  120.4 to limit it to a statement of policy, \nby relocating its procedural aspects. Former paragraphs (c) through (g) \nof Sec.  120.4, which provide\n\n[[Page 16397]]\n\ninformation about the procedures and processes for submitting a \ncommodity jurisdiction request, have been relocated to new Sec.  120.12 \ntitled Commodity Jurisdiction Determination Requests.\n\nSection 120.5 Relation to Regulations of Other Agencies\n\n    Revising the title of Sec.  120.5 to eliminate reference to export \nof items subject to the EAR in order to more accurately describe the \nscope of the revised section, which is expanded to include relation to \nnuclear related controls and the Department of Energy and Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission (formerly found at Sec.  123.20). In addition, \nrevising Sec.  120.5 to provide introductory headings to each paragraph \nto identify the related agencies. Revising existing Sec.  120.5(a) by \nlimiting its scope to the relation to the Department of Justice, moving \nthe language regarding the relation to the Department of Commerce \nbeginning at sentence 7 to a new paragraph (b), and by removing the \ncross-reference to former Sec.  123.20 which is no longer necessary \ngiven the addition of Sec.  120.5(c) (formerly found at Sec.  123.20). \nRevising Sec.  120.5(b)(2) (formerly Sec.  120.5(b)) by moving the \nsentence that says items subject to the Export Administration \nRegulations (EAR) but exported under authorization from DDTC do not \nrequire separate authorization from the Department of Commerce. That \nsentence now appears just before the sentence prohibiting the use of \nITAR exemptions for items subject to the EAR that are unaccompanied by \na defense article. DDTC believes this change minimizes possible \nconfusion regarding requirements for Commerce approval and the use of \nITAR exemptions. The change also clarifies that the reference to \n``these items'' in new sentence three applies to the items discussed in \nsentences one and two. Also, the final parenthetical to Sec.  120.5(b) \nis removed as an unnecessary restatement of general information.\n\nSection 120.6 U.S. Criminal Statutes\n\n    Revising Sec.  120.6(b) and (d) (formerly found at Sec.  \n120.27(a)(2) and (4), respectively) to update U.S. Code citations to \nthe Export Administration Act, to add a reference to the Export Control \nReform Act, and to reflect the elimination of the Appendix to Title 50.\n\nSection 120.10 Introduction to the U.S. Munitions List\n\n    Revising in Sec.  120.10(a) (formerly found at Sec.  121.1(a)) \nreference from ``[i]n this part'' to ``part 121 of this subchapter'' in \norder to reflect the move of the ``Introduction to the U.S. Munitions \nList'' from part 121 to new subpart A. Revising the paragraph heading \nin Sec.  120.10(c) (formerly found at Sec.  121.1(a)(2) from \n``Significant Military Equipment.'' to ``Significant Military Equipment \nparagraphs in the USML.'' in order to more clearly distinguish the \nexplanation of identifiers in the USML from the definition of \nsignificant military equipment at Sec.  120.36(a) (formerly found at \nSec.  120.7(a)).\n\nSection 120.11 Order of Review\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.11(c) a statement of the Department's \ninterpretation that defense articles remain controlled following \nincorporation or integration into non-defense articles.\n\nSection 120.12 Commodity Jurisdiction Determination Requests\n\n    Revising Sec.  120.12 in its entirety from its former purpose as \nthe address of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to a new \npurpose describing the process for obtaining a CJ determination. The \nrevised section is constructed by moving parts of former Sec.  120.4(a) \nand all of Sec.  120.4(f) to Sec.  120.12(a) and former Sec.  120.4(c) \nand (d)(2) to Sec.  120.12(b). Specific reference to part 121 is added \nto paragraph (a) in order to clarify that DDTC determinations using the \nCJ process are limited to defense articles and services in that part. \nPersons with questions regarding the U.S. Munitions Import List (USMIL) \nshould first address those questions to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives. The references to ``designation'' (formerly \nfound at Sec.  120.4(d)(2) and (3)) is revised to ``determination'' in \nSec.  120.12(b) and (c) in order to minimize possible confusion \nregarding commodity jurisdiction determination requests. In addition, a \nreference to Category XXI (Articles, Technical Data, and Defense \nServices Not Otherwise Enumerated) is added to paragraph (c) in order \nto clarify that the determination of the request is that the article or \nservice warrants control, but that at the time of the request the \narticle or service does not meet the criteria of a defense article or \ndefense service on the USML, or provide the equivalent performance \ncapabilities of a defense article on the USML.\n    Revising in Sec.  120.12(f) (formerly found at Sec.  120.4(b)) the \nstatement regarding registration and the CJ process. The second \nsentence of former Sec.  120.4(b) regarding the requirement to register \nfollowing a determination that a commodity is covered by the USML is \nremoved from Sec.  120.12(f) as it is a duplicative statement of the \ngeneral registration requirements found in part 122 and therefore \nunnecessary. Removal is for clarification purposes only and does not \nreflect a change in policy.\n\nSection 120.13 Registration\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.13(b) a statement of registration policy \nregarding brokering derived from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  \n129.2(a) and 129.3(a). This statement is for clarity and does not \nreflect a change in policy or regulation.\n\nSection 120.14 Licenses and Related Authorizations\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.14 a general statement of policy regarding \nactivities that are controlled and require a license or related \nauthorization. Those activities are divided into three paragraphs: (a) \nExport, reexport, retransfer, or temporary import of defense articles, \nderived from existing Sec.  123.1(a); (b) furnishing or providing \ndefense services, derived from existing Sec.  124.1(a); and (c) \nbrokering activities, derived from existing Sec.  129.4(a). The general \nstatement of policy is slightly revised from the language of the \nexisting authorization sections in that it distinguishes between \nauthorizations requiring a request for approval to be obtained from \nDDTC (i.e., the existing authorization sections), and the use of an \nexemption, for which no request is required to be submitted to DDTC.\n\nSection 120.15 Exemptions\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.15(a) an explicit statement that persons \notherwise required to register with DDTC may not utilize an exemption \nwithout being registered, derived from existing Sec.  120.1(c) and the \nNote to Sec.  122.1(b). Relocating to Sec.  120.15(b) the statement in \nformer Sec.  120.1(d) that exemptions are not available when parties to \nthe export are generally ineligible. Stating in Sec.  120.15(c) that \nexemptions generally are not available for use with Sec.  126.1 \ncountries, except as provided in that section. Stating in Sec.  \n120.15(d) that exemptions are limited as described by each specific \nexemption section, and adding in Sec.  120.15(f) (formerly found in \nSec.  125.6) an overview of the certification requirements to utilize \nan exemption to the licensing requirements of the ITAR for the export \nof technical data, which is removed and reserved.\n\nSection 120.16 Eligibility for Approvals\n\n    Revising in Sec.  120.16(a)(3) (formerly found at Sec.  \n120.1(c)(1)(iii)) reference to brokering authorizations from ``prior \napproval'' to ``approval'' to reflect current usage in part 129. Adding \nin Sec.  120.16(c) (formerly found at Sec.  120.1(c)) a new reference \nto publicly announced\n\n[[Page 16398]]\n\nDepartment of State policies regarding eligibility in order to address \nconcerns regarding the use of exemptions and public awareness of the \nstatus of end-users or other consignees.\n\nSection 120.17 End-Use Monitoring\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.17 a description of the Blue Lantern End-Use \nMonitoring program. This description did not previously appear in the \nITAR, but is added here to provide an explanation to the regulated \ncommunity of the Department's obligations pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2785 to \nvet regulated transactions both before and after licensing \ndeterminations.\n\nSection 120.18 Denial, Revocation, Suspension, or Amendment of Licenses \nand Other Approvals\n\n    Revising in Sec.  120.18(a)(2) (formerly found at Sec.  \n126.7(a)(2)) reference from ``Export Administration Act'' to ``Export \nAdministration Regulations'' to more accurately reflect the mechanism \nthrough which the Department of Commerce authorizes exports. Revising \nin Sec.  120.18(a)(6) (formerly found at Sec.  126.7(a)(6)) reference \nfrom ``debarment'' to ``order denying export privileges'' in relation \nto Department of Commerce actions in order to reflect the language of \nthe EAR. Adding in Sec.  120.18(a)(9) the statement that an unfavorable \nfinding of an end-use monitoring check may be the basis for \ndisapproving, revoking, suspending, or amending any existing license or \nlicense application.\n\nSection 120.19 Violations and Penalties\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.19 a general statement in paragraph (a) of the \nauthority to impose penalties for violations of the ITAR and a \nreference to part 127 (conduct that constitutes a violation), and in \nparagraph (b) a statement derived from existing Sec.  127.12(a) of the \nDepartment's encouragement of the voluntary disclosure of violations \nwhen discovered.\n\nSection 120.20 Administrative Procedures\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.20 general statements (derived from revised \nlanguage at existing Sec.  128.1) regarding administrative procedures \nunder the ITAR and the relationship of the AECA to the Administrative \nProcedure Act, respectively.\n\nSection 120.21 Disclosure of Information\n\n    Removing in Sec.  120.21(b) (formerly found at Sec.  126.10(b)) \nreference to section 12(c) of the Export Administration Act, to \nstreamline the text while restating the substantive requirements stated \nin the AECA.\n\nSection 120.23 Organizations and Arrangements\n\n    Creating in Sec.  120.23 a new grouping of various international \norganizations and arrangements. Revising in Sec.  120.23(a) (formerly \nfound at Sec.  120.31) the description of NATO from a static list of \nmember countries to include reference to admitted member states not \nlisted. This will prevent unnecessary amendment to the section or \npublic confusion regarding references to NATO in the ITAR and the \nstatus of member states. Adding in Sec.  120.23(c) reference to the \nWassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls not formerly found in the \nsubchapter. Removing in Sec.  120.23(d)(3) (formerly found at Sec.  \n120.29(c)) an unnecessary reference to the relevant statutory authority \nregarding Missile Technology Control Regime items and the USML in order \nto streamline the text.\n\nSection 120.37 Major Defense Equipment\n\n    Revising Sec.  120.37 (formerly found at Sec.  120.8) to more \nclosely follow the definitions structure by beginning the paragraph \nwith the defined term.\n\nSection 120.38 Classified\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.38 (formerly found at Sec.  120.46) the phrase \n``or predecessor order'' to the definition of classified to conform the \nsingle instance definition with the individual definitions of \nclassified previously found within the individual categories of the \nUSML. This change does not expand the applicable scope of the \ndefinition of classified. Corresponding changes are made to remove from \nCategories I through XXI of Sec.  121.1 individual ``Note to \nparagraph'' definitions of classified wherever found within the USML.\n\nSection 120.40 Compositional Terms\n\n    Revising the section heading from ``End-items, components, \naccessories, attachments, parts, firmware, software, systems, and \nequipment'' to ``Compositional terms'' to more accurately address the \ncontents of the section (formerly found at Sec.  120.45). The section \nas formerly written included items that could be either an element of a \ndefense article, or a defense article in and of itself, or might be a \npart (or component, etc.) of a defense article without being a defense \narticle itself. In order to clarify that the section defines terms that \ncan be used in relation to articles other than defense articles, the \nsection heading is expanded. Other changes include: Adding in Sec.  \n120.40 a new paragraph (a) to include a single instance definition of \ncommodity, formerly found in Note to paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec.  \n120.41, in order to clarify its application throughout the ITAR; and \nrevising the explanatory note to the definition of system in paragraph \n(h) (formerly found at Note to paragraph (g) of Sec.  120.45) in order \nto eliminate the redundant second sentence as unnecessary and to limit \nreference to the relevant source materials and delete the citations to \noutdated versions of those materials.\n\nSection 120.41 Specially Designed\n\n    Revising existing Sec.  120.41 to move from Sec.  120.41 those \nnotes that contain definitions of broad applicability to single \ninstance definitions in Sec. Sec.  120.42 and 120.43 and to make \ncertain non-substantive revisions to the order and numbering of notes \nto the section in accordance with Code of Federal Regulations drafting \nrequirements.\n\nSection 120.42 Form, Fit, Function, Performance Capability, Equivalent, \nEnumerated, and Catch-All Control\n\n    In Sec.  120.42 incorporating single instance definitions of form, \nfit, function, and performance capability (formerly found at Notes 1 \nand 2 to paragraph (d) of Sec.  120.4 and Note 4 to paragraph (b)(3) of \nSec.  120.41); and single instance definitions of equivalent, \nenumerated, and catch-all control (formerly found at Note 5 to \nparagraph (b)(3) and Note to paragraph (b) of Sec.  120.41). Revising \nin Sec.  120.42(f) (formerly found at Note to paragraph (b) of Sec.  \n120.41) reference from ``article on the U.S. Munitions List'' to ``item \ndesignated on the U.S. Munitions List'' to more accurately reflect the \nconstitution of the USML and to distinguish from the reference to \n``item'' in the same sentence as applied to the Export Administration \nRegulations.\n\nSection 120.43 Development, Production, and Related Terms; Basic and \nApplied Research\n\n    Adding in Sec.  120.43(a) and (b) single instance definitions of \ndevelopment and production formerly found in Sec.  120.41 specifically. \nThese single instance definitions were originally included in a \nprevious proposed rule (80 FR 31525, June 3, 2015), and were to be \ntaken from existing Notes 2 and 1, respectively, to Sec.  120.41(b)(3). \nAlthough not adopted at that time, DDTC now implements the revision. In \nresponse to the 2015 proposed rule, the Department received several \npublic comments regarding the single instance definitions for\n\n[[Page 16399]]\n\ndevelopment and production. Those comments are addressed here.\n    One commenter suggested that the department add ``but not limited \nto'' following ``such as'' in the definition of ``development.'' The \nDepartment does not make this change. The use of the term ``such as'' \nnecessarily implies that the following list is non-exclusive, so the \naddition of the phrase ``but not limited to'' is redundant.\n    Several commenters requested that the Department insert a note to \nthe definition of ``development'' to state that fabrication of \nprototypes by universities for academic demonstration or to otherwise \ntest a hypothesis is not development, because the inclusion of these \nactivities within the definition of ``development'' somehow limits the \nfundamental research exception. The Department does not make this \nchange. The Department believes that the activity is appropriately \ncaptured by the definition of ``development''.\n    A commenter requested that the Department remove the last sentence \nof the definition of ``development,'' which stated ``[d]evelopment \nincludes modification of the design of an existing item.'' The \nDepartment does not make this change. Modification of an existing \ndesign creates a distinct design, regardless of the modification.\n    A commenter suggested that the Department add engineering analysis \nand design methodology to the definition of ``development'' in place of \ndesign analysis and design concepts, and add manufacturing know-how to \nthe definition of ``production'' in place of manufacture. The \nDepartment does not make this change. The terms suggested by the \ncommenter are used in specific places in the ITAR for specific \npurposes, and their inclusion within these definitions would not \nprovide additional clarity. Additionally, the definitions of \n``development'' and ``production'' are being moved from within the \ndefinition of specially designed and made applicable to the entire \nITAR, in part, to harmonize the definition of ``technical data'' with \nthe definition of technology in the EAR. To modify these definitions \nwould result in unnecessary variation from the EAR without significant \nbenefit.\n    One commenter suggested that the Department add the Defense Federal \nAcquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) term ``advanced \ntechnological development'' to the definition of ``development.'' The \nDepartment notes the actual term is ``advanced technology development'' \nand does not make this change. While any advanced technology \ndevelopment would be included within this definition of \n``development,'' the value of adding the DFARS term is outweighed by \nthe loss of harmonization with the EAR and multilateral export control \nregimes.\n    One commenter suggested that the Department replace the term \n``serial production'' with ``production.'' The Department does not make \nthis change. Products generally pass through multiple phases of \ndevelopment, some of which may include the production of prototypes or \nprototype production facilities. All of these activities are included \nwithin the development phase of the products.\n    Several commenters noted that the definition of ``production'' \nincludes manufacture and assert that this creates a conflict with the \ndefinitions of ``manufacturing license agreement'' (MLA) and \n``technical assistance agreement'' (TAA) in Sec. Sec.  120.21 and \n120.22. The Department does not make any change. An MLA is an \n``authorization to manufacture defense articles abroad. . . .'' There \nmay be an agreement that involves technical data for the production of \na defense article that is not an ``authorization to manufacture defense \narticles abroad,'' and in these instances, an MLA would not be \nrequired. However, in instances where there is an ``authorization to \nmanufacture defense articles abroad'' that involves the export of \ntechnical data, an MLA is required regardless of the type of technical \ndata exported. One commenter noted that the provisions of Sec.  \n124.4(b)(1) through (4) apply to agreements that involve coproduction \nor licensed production outside of the United States of defense articles \nof United States origin, and asserts that the new definition of \n``production'' may implicate some TAAs, in addition to MLAs. The \ncommenter requested that Sec.  124.4(b) be revised to limit the scope \nof that provision to ``licensed manufacturing.'' The Department does \nnot make this change. The reporting requirements of Sec.  124.4(b) \napply only to ``coproduction or licensed production outside of the \nUnited States,'' which is only authorized via MLAs that involve \noffshore production. Additional revisions are not necessary.\n    One commenter stated that the definitions would undermine the \nutility of the exemption at Sec.  125.4(b)(6), which authorizes the \nexport of technical data ``related to firearms not in excess of caliber \n.50 and ammunition for such weapons, except detailed design, \ndevelopment, production or manufacturing information.'' The Department \nconfirms that these definitions do not change the scope of this \nexemption.\n    In reviewing the definition of development from the 2015 proposed \nrule, and not in response to public comment, the Department determined \nto revise the final sentence of the definition to focus on design \nrather than items. This is intended to be in keeping with the attempt \nto better align definitions across the EAR and ITAR, as expressed in \nthe 2015 proposed rule, and to clarify that development is common to \npre-production for all goods and is not specific to the USML. Although \nthe final sentence of the definition of development is not found \ndirectly in the EAR definition of development, an analogous provision \nis found in Note 2 to the definition of technology (see 15 CFR 772.1).\n    Adding in Sec.  120.43(c) through (i) single instance definitions \nand explanations of terms for design methodology, engineering analysis, \nmanufacturing know-how, build-to-print, build/design-to-specification, \nbasic research, and applied research (the definition of which was \nformerly found within the definition of basic research and which this \nrule separates into two definitions), formerly found at Sec. Sec.  \n124.2(c)(4) and 125.4(c). Although formerly described in Sec. Sec.  \n124.2(c)(4) and 125.4(c), for purposes of clarity as to the application \nof an exemption the terms were used in other locations in the ITAR, \ndemonstrating that the explanations were intended to have broader \napplicability. Conforming changes are made to citation references in \nCategory XIII(i)(6) of Sec.  121.1, Supplement No. 1 to part 126, and \nNote 5 and Note 12 to that supplement. In addition, revisions are made \nto existing Sec.  124.2(c)(4) to eliminate the unnecessary duplication \nof definitions of design methodology, engineering analysis, and \nmanufacturing know-how by deleting existing Sec.  124.2(c)(4)(i) \nthrough (iii). Also, the parenthetical explanation of build-to-print at \nexisting Sec.  124.13(b) is removed for the same reason.\n\nSection 120.57 Authorization Types\n\n    In Sec.  120.57 consolidating and incorporating single instance \ndefinitions for the various authorization types for transactions \nsubject to the ITAR (formerly found in Sec. Sec.  120.20, 120.21, \n120.22 and 120.23) and adding in Sec.  120.57(c) a single instance \ndefinition of exemption to provide a single reference for the concept, \nused throughout the ITAR, for an authorization other than by license or \nother written approval.\n\n[[Page 16400]]\n\nSection 120.68 Party to the Export\n\n    Establishing in Sec.  120.68 (formerly found at Sec.  126.7(e)) a \nsingle instance definition of ``party to the export''.\n\nPart 121 The United States Munitions List\n\n    Adding a new Sec.  121.0 to provide cross-reference to Sec. Sec.  \n120.10 and 120.11, Introduction to the U.S. Munitions List and Order of \nreview, respectively (formerly found at paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec.  \n121.1). Removing and reserving paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec.  121.1. \nRevising for purpose of consistency only the technical data and defense \nservice definition parentheticals in the technical data paragraphs for \nall categories previously revised as part of the multi-year process of \nreviewing and revising the USML as part of the USML to the Commerce \nControl List (CCL) process, beginning with 78 FR 22740, Apr. 16, 2013. \nThese revisions are not intended to make any substantive change. \nPreviously, these paragraphs used ``see'' and ``as defined in'' \ninterchangeably. Removing from the USML those notes to category \nparagraphs that contain definitions for ``classified'' in order to \npreclude any variation from the definition of classified in Sec.  \n120.38 (formerly found at Sec.  120.46). Removing the parentheticals \n``(see Sec.  120.4 of this subchapter)'' relating to commodity \njurisdiction, ``(see Sec.  120.42 of this subchapter)'' relating to \n``subject to the EAR'', and the phrase ``(see Sec.  120.10(a)(2) of \nthis subchapter)'' relating to ``classified'' as they are either used \ninconsistently or because they are generally understood by the \nregulated community and defined elsewhere in the regulations. Finally, \ncross-references to sections moved by this rule are updated.\n\nSection 128.1 Exclusion of Functions From the Administrative Procedure \nAct\n\n    Revising Sec.  128.1 to clarify that the Secretary of State has \nbeen delegated authority to make licensing decisions.\n\nSection 128.2 Administrative Law Judge\n\n    Revising Sec.  128.2 regarding authorities of an Administrative Law \nJudge to eliminate reference to Sec.  127.7. This change clarifies that \nan Administrative Law Judge may only recommend debarment pursuant to \nthat section, and any such order is issued by the Assistant Secretary \nof State for Political-Military Affairs.\n\nOther Revisions\n\n    Removing and reserving Sec.  120.26, Presiding Official, as \nunnecessary as the term does not otherwise appear in the regulations.\n    Removing the list of forms referenced in the ITAR and formerly \nfound at Sec.  120.28. This section, which provides the list of forms \nreferred to in the ITAR, is being removed in its entirety as an \nunnecessary inclusion to the regulations. Due to previous revisions to \nthe regulations, the list presented is not accurate. In order to \nprevent unnecessary regulatory activity in the form of future \nconforming revisions to the section, due to expected changes to the \nforms that appear in the regulations, it is being removed and the \nsection reserved.\n    Reserving Sec.  120.29 (formerly Missile Technology Control Regime) \nand moving the former text of Sec.  120.29 to paragraph (d) of new \nSec.  120.23, Organizations and arrangements.\n    Reserving Sec.  120.46 (formerly Classified) and moving the former \ntext of Sec.  120.46 to new Sec.  120.38.\n    Reserving Sec.  123.20 (formerly Nuclear related controls) and \nmoving the former text of Sec.  123.20 to new Sec.  120.5(c).\n    Reserving Sec.  123.26 (formerly Recordkeeping for exemptions) and \nmoving the requirements of the former Sec.  123.26 to new Sec.  \n120.15(e).\n    Reserving Sec.  125.6 (formerly Certification requirements for \nexemptions) and moving and revising the former text of Sec.  125.6 as \ndescribed in the discussion of Sec.  120.15 above.\n    Reserving Sec.  126.7 (formerly Denial, revocation, suspension, or \namendment of licenses and other approvals) and moving the former text \nof Sec.  126.7(a)-(d) and (e) to new Sec. Sec.  120.18 and 120.68, \nrespectively.\n    Reserving Sec.  126.9 (formerly Advisory opinions and related \nauthorizations) and moving the former text of Sec.  126.9 to new Sec.  \n120.22.\n    Reserving Sec.  126.10 (formerly Disclosure of information) and \nmoving the former text of Sec.  126.10 to new Sec.  120.21.\n    Reserving Sec. Sec.  126.11 and 126.12 (formerly Relations to other \nprovisions of law, and Continuation in force, respectively) and moving \nthe former text of each to new Sec.  120.7(a) and (b), respectively.\n    Removing in its entirety the MTCR Annex formerly found at Sec.  \n121.16, as the relevant information of the MTCR Annex is conveyed \ndirectly through notations in the USML and to eliminate unnecessary \nsections of the ITAR and the obligation to amend to reflect revisions \nto the MTCR Annex in both the USML and in former Sec.  121.16, in \nconjunction with the adoption of reference to the Missile Technology \nControl Regime in new Sec.  120.23(d).\n    Revising references to ``U.S. Government'' from ``U.S. government'' \nat Sec. Sec.  120.11(d), 120.18(a)(6), and 120.34(a)(7).\n    Revising order and numbering of notes to affected sections in \naccordance with Code of Federal Regulations drafting requirements.\n    Revising formatting of cites and signals wherever found for \nconsistency of application.\n    The following former paragraphs of the ITAR were marked as reserved \nand are removed by this rule: Sec. Sec.  120.27(a)(11), 120.27(b), and \n125.4(d).\n    Definitions of general applicability from throughout the subchapter \nare consolidated in Part 120--Purpose and Definitions, Subpart C--\nDefinitions. These movements are identified in the table below. Cross \nreferences are revised throughout the subchapter and efforts were made \nto standardize certain terminologies (e.g., reference to ``subject to \nthe ITAR'' revised to the more commonly used ``subject to this \nsubchapter'') and in the use of abbreviations and acronyms.\n    This rule primarily moves and reorganizes existing regulatory text \nwithout revision. Much of this text was drafted at different times, by \ndifferent authors. The Department intends to propose additional \nrevisions to regulatory text to improve readability and flow.\n    The table below identifies to the sentence level all:\n\n    1. Movements or renumbering of text made by this rule from their \nformer location to the location as effected by this rule. The former \nlocation of moved text is italicized.\n    2. All text revised in any manner by this rule, whether moved or \nnot. Revised sections, paragraphs, and text locations appear in \nbold.\n    3. All text removed/reserved from the ITAR in any location. \nRemoved sections, paragraphs, and text locations appear as \nstrikethrough.\n    4. Any new general information text sections that are derived \nfrom an existing ITAR section which is not revised or removed are \nidentified in the ``Model for'' column and the source material \nidentified by underlined text.\n    5. Where a section or paragraph is moved, revised, and/or formed \nthe basis for new text elsewhere, it is identified by each font type \n(e.g., the text of Sec.  123.26 is revised and moved and the section \nreserved, so it appears in the table as bold struck through text).\n    6. Each level (to the sentence) of any section affected by this \nrule is identified by a unique row and then by font type within the \nrow. For example, the first six rows of the table identify changes \nto Sec.  120.1. Row 1 shows Sec.  120.1 in bold, indicating a change \nto the text of the section title. Row two shows paragraph (a) in \nbold, indicating a change to the text of that paragraph. Row three \nshows\n\n[[Page 16401]]\n\nparagraph (b) in bold, indicating a change to the text of that \nparagraph. Row four shows paragraph (1) under paragraph (b) in bold, \nindicating a change to the text of paragraph (b)(1). Row five shows \nparagraph (ii) in bold and paragraph (2) in regular text under \nparagraph (b), indicating a change in text to paragraph (b)(2)(ii), \nbut no change to the text of paragraph (b)(2) itself. Finally, row \nsix shows paragraph (c) in italic and underlined, indicating that \nthe paragraph has been moved (but not revised) and relocated to \npost-rule location Sec.  120.16 as well as providing the basis for \nnew text at Sec.  120.15(b). Subsequent rows show the new locations \nof paragraphs within prior Sec.  120.1(c).\n    7. Where consecutive paragraphs within a section are affected in \nthe same manner, they are combined into a single row. See, e.g., \nSec.  120.9, where paragraph (a)(1) is in a single row and \nidentified in italic as having been moved to Sec.  120.32(a)(1), and \nparagraphs (a)(2) and (3) are in a single row and both identified in \nbold and italic as having been revised and moved to Sec.  \n120.32(a)(2) and (3).\nBILLING CODE 4710-25-P\n\n[[Page 16402]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.001\n\n\n[[Page 16403]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.002\n\n\n[[Page 16404]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.003\n\n\n[[Page 16405]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.004\n\n\n[[Page 16406]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.005\n\n\n[[Page 16407]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.006\n\n\n[[Page 16408]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.007\n\n\n[[Page 16409]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.008\n\n\n[[Page 16410]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR22.009\n\nBILLING CODE 4710-25-C\n\nRegulatory Analysis and Notices\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department of State is of the opinion that controlling the \nimport and export of defense articles and services is a military or \nforeign affairs function of the United States Government and that rules \nimplementing this function are exempt from sections 553 (rulemaking) \nand 554 (adjudications) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). \nAlthough the Department is of the opinion that this interim final rule \nis exempt from the rulemaking provisions of the APA, the Department is \npublishing this rule as an interim final rule and with a 45-day \nprovision for public comment and without prejudice to its determination \nthat controlling the import and export of defense services is a foreign \naffairs function.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    Since the Department is of the opinion that this interim final rule \nis exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, there is no requirement \nfor an analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This amendment does not involve a mandate that will result in the \nexpenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, \nor by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any year and it \nwill not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, \nno actions were deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    This rulemaking has been found not to be a major rule within the \ndefinition of Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of \n1996.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132\n\n    This rulemaking will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive \nOrder 13132, it is determined that this rulemaking does not have \nsufficient federalism implications to require consultations or warrant \nthe preparation of a federalism summary impact statement. The \nregulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding \nintergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess costs \nand benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is \nnecessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits \n(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety \neffects, distributed impacts, and equity). These executive orders \nstress the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of \nreducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. \nAlthough the Department is of the opinion that this rulemaking is \nexempt from Executive Order 12866 as this rule pertains to a military \nor foreign affairs function of the United States as provided in Section \n3(d)(2), the Department nevertheless has determined that, given the \nnature of the amendments made in this rulemaking, there will be no \nchange to any person's substantive rights or obligations as a result of \nthis rule, and the only cost to the public, the cost of updating \ncompliance regimes to account for the movement of regulatory text \nwithin the ITAR, is less than the benefit to the public in the \nincreased utility of the ITAR. Therefore, the benefits of this \nrulemaking outweigh the cost. This rule has been designated a \n``significant regulatory action,'' although not economically \nsignificant, by the Office and Information and Regulatory Affairs under \nExecutive Order 12866.\n\nExecutive Order 12988\n\n    The Department of State reviewed this rulemaking in light of \nsections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate \nambiguity, minimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and \nreduce burden.\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    The Department of State determined that this rulemaking will not \nhave tribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not preempt tribal law. \nAccordingly, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.

Section 38 of the Arms Export Control \nAct (22 U.S.C. 2778), as amended, authorizes the President to control \nthe export and import of defense articles and defense services. The \nstatutory authority of the President to promulgate regulations with \nrespect to exports of defense articles and defense services is \ndelegated to the Secretary of State by Executive Order 13637. This \nsubchapter implements that authority, as well as other relevant \nauthorities in the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.). \nThe Secretary of State delegates the authority to administer the \nregulations in this subchapter to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nState for Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.\n    (b) Authorized officials. (1) All authorities administered by the \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State for Defense Trade Controls pursuant \nto this subchapter may be exercised at any time by the Under Secretary \nof State for Arms Control and International Security or the Assistant \nSecretary of State for Political-Military Affairs.\n    (2) The Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Defense Trade \nControls supervises the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which is \ncomprised of the following offices:\n    (i) The Office of Defense Trade Controls Licensing and the \nDirector, Office of Defense Trade Controls Licensing, which have \nresponsibilities related to licensing or other approvals of defense \ntrade, including references under this part and parts 123, 124, 125, \n126, 129, and 130 of this subchapter.\n    (ii) The Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance and the \nDirector, Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, which have \nresponsibilities related to violations of law or regulation and \ncompliance therewith, including references contained in parts 122, 126, \n127, 128, and 130 of this subchapter, and those portions under this \npart and part 129 of this subchapter pertaining to registration.\n    (iii) The Office of Defense Trade Controls Policy and the Director, \nOffice of Defense Trade Controls Policy, which have responsibilities \nrelated to the general policies of defense trade, including references \nunder this part and part 126 of this subchapter, and the commodity \njurisdiction procedure under this part.\n\n\nSec.  120.2  Designation of defense articles and defense services.\n\n    The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(a) and 2794(7)) \nprovides that the President shall designate the articles and services \ndeemed to be defense articles and defense services for purposes of \nimport or export controls. The President has delegated to the Secretary \nof State the authority to control the export and temporary import of \ndefense articles and services. The items designated by the Secretary of \nState for purposes of export and temporary import control constitute \nthe U.S. Munitions List (USML) specified in part 121 of this \nsubchapter. Defense articles on the USML specified in part 121 of this \nsubchapter that are also subject to permanent import control by the \nAttorney General on the U.S. Munitions Import List enumerated in 27 CFR \npart 447 are subject to temporary import controls administered by the \nSecretary of State. Designations of defense articles and defense \nservices on the USML in part 121 of this subchapter are made by the \nDepartment of State with the concurrence of the Department of Defense. \nThe scope of the USML shall\n\n[[Page 16412]]\n\nbe changed only by amendments made pursuant to section 38 of the Arms \nExport Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778). For a designation or determination \non whether a particular item is enumerated on the USML, see Sec.  \n120.4.\n\n\nSec.  120.3   Policy on designating or determining defense articles and \nservices on the U.S. Munitions List.\n\n    (a) For purposes of this subchapter, a specific article or service \nmay be designated a defense article (see Sec.  120.31) or defense \nservice (see Sec.  120.32) if it:\n    (1) Meets the criteria of a defense article or defense service on \nthe U.S. Munitions List (USML) (part 121 of this subchapter); or\n    (2) Provides the equivalent performance capabilities of a defense \narticle on the USML.\n    (b) For purposes of this subchapter, a specific article or service \nshall be determined in the future as a defense article or defense \nservice if it provides a critical military or intelligence advantage \nsuch that it warrants control under this subchapter.\n\n    Note 1 to paragraphs (a) and (b): An article or service \ndetermined in the future pursuant to this subchapter as a defense \narticle or defense service, but not currently on the USML, will be \nplaced in Category XXI of Sec.  121.1 of this subchapter until the \nappropriate category of the USML has been amended to provide the \nnecessary entry.\n\n    (c) A specific article or service is not a defense article or \ndefense service for purposes of this subchapter if it:\n    (1) Is determined to be under the jurisdiction of another \ndepartment or agency of the U.S. Government (see Sec.  120.5) pursuant \nto a commodity jurisdiction determination (see Sec.  120.4) unless \nsuperseded by changes to the USML or by a subsequent commodity \njurisdiction determination; or\n    (2) Meets one of the criteria of Sec.  120.41(b) when the article \nis used in or with a defense article and specially designed is used as \na control criteria.\n\n    Note 2 to Sec.  120.3: The intended use of the article or \nservice after its export (i.e., for a military or civilian purpose), \nby itself, is not a factor in determining whether the article or \nservice is subject to the controls of this subchapter.\n\nSec.  120.4  Commodity jurisdiction.\n\n    (a) The commodity jurisdiction procedure is used with the U.S. \nGovernment if doubt exists as to whether an article or service is \ncovered by the U.S. Munitions List (USML). It may also be used for \nconsideration of a redesignation of an article or service currently \ncovered by the USML. The Department must provide notice to Congress at \nleast 30 days before any item is removed from the USML.\n    (b) The procedure for submitting a Commodity Jurisdiction \nDetermination Request to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls is \nset forth in Sec.  120.12.\n\n\nSec.  120.5   Relation to regulations of other agencies.\n\n    (a) The Department of Justice, the U.S. Munitions Import List \n(USMIL), and permanent imports. Defense articles and defense services \ncovered by the U.S. Munitions List set forth in this subchapter are \nregulated by the Department of State (see also Sec.  120.2) for \npurposes of export, reexport, retransfer, and temporary import. The \nPresident has delegated the authority to control the permanent import \nof defense articles and services to the Attorney General. The defense \narticles and services controlled by the Secretary of State and the \nAttorney General collectively comprise the U.S. Munitions List under \nthe Arms Export Control Act. As the Attorney General exercises \nindependent delegated authority to designate defense articles and \nservices for purposes of permanent import controls, the permanent \nimport control list administered by the Department of Justice has been \nseparately labeled the U.S. Munitions Import List (27 CFR part 447) to \ndistinguish it from the list set out in this subchapter. In carrying \nout the functions delegated to the Attorney General pursuant to the \nArms Export Control Act, the Attorney General shall be guided by the \nviews of the Secretary of State on matters affecting world peace and \nthe external security and foreign policy of the United States.\n    (b) The Department of Commerce and the Export Administration \nRegulations--(1) Export of items subject to the Export Administration \nRegulations by authority of the Department of Commerce. The Department \nof Commerce regulates the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of \nitems on the Commerce Control List and other items subject to its \njurisdiction, as well as certain activities performed by U.S. persons, \nincluding those that may contribute to the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 \nCFR parts 730 through 774).\n    (2) Export of items subject to the EAR by authority of the \nDepartment of State. A license or other approval (see Sec.  120.57) \nfrom the Department of State granted in accordance with this subchapter \nmay also authorize the export of items subject to the EAR (see Sec.  \n120.58). An exemption (see Sec.  120.57 and parts 123, 124, 125, and \n126 of this subchapter) may only be used to export an item subject to \nthe EAR that is for use in or with a defense article and is included in \nthe same shipment as any defense article. Separate approval from the \nDepartment of Commerce is not required for these items. No exemption \nunder this subchapter may be utilized to export an item subject to the \nEAR if not accompanied by a defense article. Those items subject to the \nEAR exported pursuant to a Department of State license or other \napproval would remain under the jurisdiction of the Department of \nCommerce for any subsequent transactions. The inclusion of items \nsubject to the EAR on a Department of State license or other approval \ndoes not change the licensing jurisdiction of the items.\n    (c) Nuclear related controls; Department of Energy and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. (1) The provisions of this subchapter do not \napply to articles, technical data, or services in Category VI, Category \nXV, Category XVI, and Category XX of Sec.  121.1 of this subchapter to \nthe extent that exports of such articles, technical data, or services \nare controlled by the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended, \nand the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, as amended, or are \ngovernment transfers authorized pursuant to these Acts.

Sec.  120.8-120.9   [Reserved]\n\nSubpart B--General Policies and Processes\n\n\nSec.  120.10  Introduction to the U.S. Munitions List.\n\n    (a) The U.S. Munitions List. The articles, services, and related \ntechnical data designated as defense articles or defense services \npursuant to sections 38 and 47(7) of the Arms Export Control Act appear \nin part 121 of this subchapter and constitute the U.S. Munitions List \n(USML). Changes in designations are published in the Federal Register. \nParagraphs (b) through (d) of this section describe or explain the \nelements of a USML category.\n    (b) Composition of U.S. Munitions List categories. USML categories \nare organized by paragraphs and subparagraphs identified \nalphanumerically. They usually start by enumerating or otherwise \ndescribing end-items, followed by major systems and equipment; parts, \ncomponents, accessories, and attachments; and technical data and \ndefense services directly related to the defense articles of that USML \ncategory.\n    (c) Significant Military Equipment paragraphs in the USML. All \nitems described within a USML paragraph or subordinate paragraph that \nis preceded by an asterisk (*) are designated Significant Military \nEquipment (SME). Note that technical data directly related to the \nmanufacture or production of a defense article designated as SME is \nalso designated as SME.\n    (d) Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) designation. \nAnnotation with the parenthetical (MT) at the end of a USML entry \nindicates those defense articles that are on the MTCR Annex.\n\n\nSec.  120.11   Order of review.\n\n    (a) Control. Articles are controlled on the U.S. Munitions List \n(USML) because they are either:\n    (1) Enumerated in a category; or\n    (2) Described in a catch-all paragraph that incorporates specially \ndesigned as a\n\n[[Page 16414]]\n\ncontrol parameter. In order to classify an item on the USML, begin with \na review of the general characteristics of the item. This should guide \nyou to the appropriate category, whereupon you should attempt to match \nthe particular characteristics and functions of the article to a \nspecific entry within that category.\n    (b) Specially designed. (1) If the entry includes the term \nspecially designed, refer to Sec.  120.41 to determine if the article \nqualifies for one or more of the exclusions articulated in Sec.  \n120.41(b).\n    (2) An item described in multiple entries should be categorized \naccording to an enumerated entry rather than a specially designed \ncatch-all paragraph.\n    (c) Integration of controlled items. Defense articles described on \nthe USML are controlled and remain subject to this subchapter following \nincorporation or integration into any item not described on the USML, \nunless specifically provided otherwise in this subchapter.\n    (d) Other controls. In all cases, articles not controlled on the \nUSML may be subject to another U.S. Government regulatory agency (see \nSec.  120.5, and Supplement No. 4 to part 774 of the Export \nAdministration Regulations (EAR) in title 15 of the CFR for guidance on \nclassifying an item subject to the EAR).\n\n\nSec.  120.12   Commodity jurisdiction determination requests.\n\n    (a) Upon electronic submission of a Commodity Jurisdiction \nDetermination Form (Form DS-4076), the Directorate of Defense Trade \nControls (DDTC) shall provide a determination of whether a particular \narticle or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List in part 121 of \nthis subchapter. The determination, consistent with Sec. Sec.  120.2, \n120.3, and 120.4, entails consultation among the Departments of State, \nDefense, Commerce, and other U.S. Government agencies and industry in \nappropriate cases. State, Defense, and Commerce will resolve commodity \njurisdiction determination disputes in accordance with established \nprocedures. State shall notify Defense and Commerce, and other U.S. \nGovernment agencies as appropriate, of the initiation and conclusion of \neach case.\n    (b) A determination that an article or service meets the criteria \nof a defense article or defense service, or provides the equivalent \nperformance capabilities of a defense article on the U.S. Munitions \nList, is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account:\n    (1) The form and fit of the article;\n    (2) The function and performance capability of the article; and\n    (3) Other applicant-provided information, to include a history of \nthe product's design, development, and use, as well as specifications \nand any other relevant data as described in brochures and other related \ndocuments.\n    (c) A determination that an article or service has a critical \nmilitary or intelligence advantage such that it warrants control under \nCategory XXI of Sec.  121.1 of this subchapter is made, on a case-by-\ncase basis, taking into account:\n    (1) The function and performance capability of the article; and\n    (2) The nature of controls imposed by other nations on such items \n(including the Wassenaar Arrangement and other multilateral controls).\n    (d) DDTC will provide a preliminary response within 10 working days \nof receipt of a complete request for commodity jurisdiction \ndetermination. If after 45 days DDTC has not provided a final commodity \njurisdiction determination, the applicant may request in writing to the \nDirector, Office of Defense Trade Controls Policy that this \ndetermination be given expedited processing.\n    (e) A person may appeal a commodity jurisdiction determination by \nsubmitting a written request for reconsideration to the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State for Defense Trade Controls.

The approval of DDTC must be \nrequested and obtained before a defense service may be furnished, \nunless an exemption under the provisions of this subchapter is \napplicable.\n    (c) Brokering activities. The approval of DDTC must be requested \nand obtained before engaging in the business of brokering activities \nfor the defense articles described in Sec.  129.4(a) of this subchapter \nby a person who is required to register as a broker under part 129 of \nthis subchapter, unless an exemption under the provisions of part 129 \nis applicable.\n\n\nSec.  120.15   Exemptions.\n\n    (a) Persons otherwise required to register with the Directorate of \nDefense Trade Controls in accordance with this subchapter must do so \nprior to utilization of an exemption.\n    (b) Exemptions provided in this subchapter may not be utilized for \ntransactions in which the exporter, any party to the export, any source \nor manufacturer, broker or other participant in the brokering \nactivities, is generally ineligible as set forth in Sec.  120.16, \nunless prior written authorization has been granted by the Directorate \nof Defense Trade Controls.\n    (c) Exemptions provided in this subchapter do not apply with \nrespect to defense articles or defense services originating in or for \nexport to any proscribed countries, areas, or persons identified in \nSec.  126.1 of this subchapter, except as provided in Sec.  126.1.\n    (d) Each exemption provided in this subchapter is subject to \nlimitation as described in the section or paragraph of this subchapter \nin which the exemption is prescribed.\n    (e) Any person engaging in any export, reexport, transfer, or \nretransfer of a defense article or defense service pursuant to an \nexemption must maintain records of each such export, reexport, \ntransfer, or retransfer. The records shall, to the extent applicable to \nthe transaction and consistent with the\n\n[[Page 16415]]\n\nrequirements of Sec.  123.22 of this subchapter, include the following \ninformation: A description of the defense article, including technical \ndata, or defense service; the name and address of the end-user and \nother available contact information (e.g., telephone number and \nelectronic mail address); the name of the natural person responsible \nfor the transaction; the stated end-use of the defense article or \ndefense service; the date of the transaction; the Electronic Export \nInformation (EEI) Internal Transaction Number (ITN); and the method of \ntransmission. The person using or acting in reliance upon the exemption \nshall also comply with any additional recordkeeping requirements \nenumerated in the text of the regulations concerning such exemption \n(e.g., requirements specific to the Defense Trade Cooperation Treaties \nin Sec. Sec.  126.16 and 126.17 of this subchapter).\n    (f) To claim an exemption for the export of technical data under \nthe provisions of this subchapter (e.g., Sec. Sec.  125.4 and 125.5 of \nthis subchapter), the exporter must certify that the proposed export is \ncovered by a relevant section of this subchapter, to include the \nparagraph and applicable subordinate paragraph. Certifications consist \nof clearly marking the package or letter containing the technical data \n``22 CFR [insert ITAR exemption] applicable.'' This certification must \nbe made in written form and retained in the exporter's files for a \nperiod of 5 years. For exports that are oral, visual, or electronic the \nexporter must also complete a written certification and retain it for a \nperiod of 5 years.\n\n\nSec.  120.16  Eligibility for approvals.\n\n    (a) A U.S. person may receive a license or other approval pursuant \nto this subchapter.

Pursuant to delegated authorities, the Secretary of \nState is authorized to make decisions on whether license applications \nor other written requests for approval shall be granted, or whether \nexemptions may be used. The Secretary of State is also authorized to \nrevoke, suspend, or amend licenses or other written approvals whenever \nsuch action is deemed to be advisable. The administration of the AECA \nis a foreign affairs function encompassed within the meaning of the \nmilitary and foreign affairs exclusion of the Administrative Procedure \nAct and is thereby expressly exempt from various provisions of that \nAct. Because the exercising of the foreign affairs function, including \nthe decisions required to implement the AECA, is highly discretionary, \nit is excluded from review under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\nSec.  120.21   Disclosure of information.\n\n    (a) Freedom of information. Subchapter R of this title contains \nregulations on the availability to the public of information and \nrecords of the Department of State. The provisions of subchapter R \napply to such disclosures by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.\n    (b) Determinations required by law. Section 38(e) of the Arms \nExport Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2778(e)) provides that information \nobtained for the purpose of consideration of, or concerning, license \napplications shall be withheld from public disclosure unless the \nrelease of such information is determined by the Secretary of State to \nbe in the national interest. Section 38(e) of the AECA further provides \nthat the names of countries and types and quantities of defense \narticles for which licenses are issued under this section shall not be \nwithheld from public disclosure unless certain determinations are made \nthat the release of such information would be contrary to the national \ninterest. Such determinations required by section 38(e) shall be made \nby the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs.\n    (c) Information required under part 130 of this subchapter. Part \n130 contains specific provisions on the disclosure of information \ndescribed in that part.\n    (d) National interest determinations. In accordance with section \n38(e) of the AECA, the Secretary of State has determined that the \nfollowing disclosures are in the national interest of the United \nStates:\n    (1) Furnishing information to foreign governments for law \nenforcement or regulatory purposes; and\n    (2) Furnishing information to foreign governments and other \nagencies of the U.S. Government in the context of multilateral or \nbilateral export regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime, \nthe Australia Group, and Wassenaar Arrangement).\n\n\nSec.  120.22   Advisory opinions and related authorizations.\n\n    (a) Preliminary authorization determinations. A person may request \ninformation from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) as to \nwhether it would likely grant a license or other approval for a \nparticular defense article or defense service to a particular country. \nSuch information from DDTC is issued on a case-by-case basis and \napplies only to the particular matters presented to DDTC. These \nopinions are not binding on the Department of State and may not be used \nin future matters before the Department.

For software, the fit is defined by its ability to \ninterface or connect with a defense article.\n    (c) Function. The function of a commodity is the action or actions \nit is designed to perform. For software, the function means the action \nor actions the software performs directly related to a defense article \nor as a standalone application.\n    (d) Performance capability. Performance capability is the measure \nof a commodity's effectiveness to perform a designated function in a \ngiven environment (e.g., measured in terms of speed, durability, \nreliability, pressure, accuracy, efficiency). For software, performance \ncapability means the measure of the software's effectiveness to perform \na designated function.\n    (e) Equivalent. With respect to a commodity, equivalent means its \nform has been modified solely for fit purposes.\n    (f) Enumerated. Enumerated refers to any item designated on the \nU.S. Munitions List or item on the Commerce Control List and not in a \ncatch-all control.\n    (g) Catch-all control. A catch-all control is one that does not \nrefer to specific types of parts, components, accessories, or \nattachments, but rather controls unspecified parts, components, \naccessories, or attachments only if they were specially designed for an \nenumerated item.\n\n\nSec.  120.43  Development, production, and related terms; Basic and \napplied research.\n\n    (a) Development is related to all stages prior to serial \nproduction, such as design, design research, design analyses, design \nconcepts, assembly and testing of prototypes, pilot production schemes, \ndesign data, process of transforming design data into a product, \nconfiguration design, integration design, and layouts. Development \nincludes modification of an existing design.\n    (b)(1) Production means all production stages, such as product \nengineering, manufacture, integration, assembly (mounting), inspection, \ntesting, and quality assurance. This includes serial production where \ncommodities have passed production readiness testing (i.e., an \napproved, standardized design ready for large scale production) and \nhave been or are being produced on an assembly line for multiple \ncommodities using the approved, standardized design.\n    (2) Commodities in production that are subsequently subject to \ndevelopment activities, such as those that would result in enhancements \nor improvements only in the reliability or maintainability of the \ncommodity (e.g., an increased mean time between failure), including \nthose pertaining to quality improvements, cost reductions, or feature \nenhancements, remain in production. However, any new models or versions \nof such commodities developed from such efforts that change the basic \nperformance or capability of the commodity are in development until and \nunless they enter into production.\n    (c) Design methodology includes the underlying engineering methods \nand design philosophy utilized (i.e., information that explains the \nrationale for a particular design decision, engineering feature, or \nperformance requirement); engineering experience (e.g., lessons \nlearned); and the rationale and associated databases (e.g., design \nallowables, factors of safety, component life predictions, failure \nanalysis criteria) that establish the operational requirements (e.g., \nperformance, mechanical, electrical, electronic, reliability and \nmaintainability) of a defense article. (Final analytical results and \nthe initial conditions and parameters may be provided.)\n    (d) Engineering analysis includes the analytical methods and tools \nused to design or evaluate a defense article's performance against the \noperational requirements. Analytical methods and tools include the \ndevelopment and/or use of mockups, computer models and simulations, and \ntest facilities.

This transaction is based strictly on a hands-off approach \nsince the foreign consignee is understood to have the inherent \ncapability to produce the defense article and only lacks the necessary \ndrawings. Supporting documentation (e.g., acceptance criteria, object \ncode software for numerically controlled machines) may be released on \nan as-required basis (i.e., must have) such that the foreign consignee \nwould not be able to produce an acceptable defense article without this \nadditional supporting documentation. Build-to-print does not include \nthe release of any information which discloses design methodology, \nengineering analysis, detailed process information or manufacturing \nknow-how. Documentation which is not absolutely necessary to permit \nmanufacture of an acceptable defense article (i.e. nice to have) is not \nconsidered within the boundaries of a build-to-print data package.\n    (g) Build/design-to-specification means that a foreign consignee \ncan design and produce a defense article from requirement \nspecifications without any technical assistance from the U.S. exporter. \nThis transaction is based strictly on a hands-off approach since the \nforeign consignee is understood to have the inherent capability to both \ndesign and produce the defense article and only lacks the necessary \nrequirement information.\n    (h) Basic research means a systemic study directed toward greater \nknowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and \nobservable facts without specific applications towards processes or \nproducts in mind. It does not include applied research.\n    (i) Applied research means a systemic study to gain knowledge or \nunderstanding necessary to determine the means by which a recognized \nand specific need may be met. It is a systematic application of \nknowledge toward the production of useful materials, devices, and \nsystems or methods, including design, development, and improvement of \nprototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements.\n\n\nSec.  120.44   [Reserved]\n\n\nSec.  120.45  Maintenance levels.\n\n    (a) Organizational-level maintenance (or basic-level maintenance) \nis the first level of maintenance that can be performed on-equipment \n(directly on the defense article or support equipment) without \nspecialized training. It consists of repairing, inspecting, servicing, \ncalibrating, lubricating, or adjusting equipment, as well as replacing \nminor parts, components, assemblies, and line-replaceable spares or \nunits. This includes modifications, enhancements, or upgrades that \nwould result in improving only the reliability or maintainability of \nthe commodity (e.g., an increased mean time between failure) and does \nnot enhance the basic performance or capability of the defense article.\n    (b) Intermediate-level maintenance is second-level maintenance \nperformed off-equipment (on removed parts, components, or equipment) at \nor by designated maintenance shops or centers, tenders, or field teams. \nIt may consist of calibrating, repairing, testing, or replacing damaged \nor unserviceable parts, components, or assemblies. This includes \nmodifications, enhancements, or upgrades that would result in improving \nonly the reliability or maintainability of the commodity (e.g., an \nincreased mean time between failure) and does not enhance the basic \nperformance or capability of the defense article.\n    (c) Depot-level maintenance is third-level maintenance performed \non- or off-equipment at or by a major repair facility, shipyard, or \nfield team, each with necessary equipment and personnel of requisite \ntechnical skill. It consists of providing evaluation or repair beyond \nunit or organization capability. This maintenance consists of \ninspecting, testing, calibrating, repairing, overhauling, refurbishing, \nreconditioning, and one-to-one replacing of any defective parts, \ncomponents, or assemblies. This includes modifications, enhancements, \nor upgrades that would result in improving only the reliability or \nmaintainability of the commodity (e.g., an increased mean time between \nfailure) and does not enhance the basic performance or capability of \nthe defense article.\n\n\nSec.

    "supplementary_information": "I. What changes to 22 CFR 22.1, 42.71, and 42.74 does the Department \nmake?\n\n    The Department is amending 22 CFR 22.1 and 42.71 to exempt \napplicants who were denied an IV under section 212(f) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) on or between December 8, 2017, \nand January 19, 2020, due to Presidential Proclamations 9645 and 9983 \n(collectively, ``Proc. 9645/9983'') from the payment of immigrant visa \nfees. The Department is also correcting a typographical error in 22 CFR \n22.1, Item 32(e), which should refer to 22 CFR 42.71, not 22 CFR 42.74, \nand correcting the header for Sec.  42.71(b)(2) to specifically refer \nto adoptees. The Department is also correcting a formatting error in 22 \nCFR 42.74(a).\n\nII. Policy Justification\n\n    On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed Proclamation 10141, \n``Ending Discriminatory Bans on Entry to the United States'' (Proc. \n10141), which revoked Proc. 9645/9983. Among other requirements, Proc. \n10141 directed the Department to create ``a proposal to ensure that \nindividuals whose immigrant visa applications were denied on the basis \nof the suspension and restriction on entry imposed by Proclamation 9645 \nor 9983 may have their applications reconsidered'' and that the \nproposal ``shall consider whether to reopen immigrant visa applications \nthat were denied'' and ``whether it is necessary to charge an \nadditional fee to process those visa applications.''\n    An IV applicant who is the beneficiary of a valid immigration \npetition may submit another visa application after being refused and in \nmost circumstances they are required to pay again the relevant \napplication fees. With this final rule, the Department exempts from \nsuch fees only those IV applicants who are applying again after being \nrefused an IV pursuant to Proc. 9645/9983, with that limitation on \nscope being justified by the President's findings articulated in Proc. \n10141, as described below. Many IV applicants denied under Proc. 9645/\n9983, assuming no material change in circumstances, may now be eligible \nfor a visa, and the Department is exempting this defined category of IV \napplicants from payment of IV fees if they apply again for an immigrant \nvisa.\n    Some applicants were initially denied IVs under the Proc. 9645/9983 \nand additional refusal grounds. These applicants are not eligible for \nthe fee exemption established by this final rule, unless a consular \nofficer has previously determined, and informed the applicant in a visa \ndenial letter, that the refusal on other grounds has been overcome and \nthe only impediment to issuance of an IV on January 20, 2021, was Proc. \n9645/9983, as reflected in a denial under section 212(f) of the INA, 8 \nU.S.C. 1182(f). If the other refusal grounds have not been overcome, \nthe applicant will be required to pay the IV fees if they wish to apply \nagain for an immigrant visa.\n    This final rule also does not apply to IV applicants who were \nrefused due to Proc. 9645/9983 on or after January 20, 2020, as 22 CFR \n42.81(e) provides for the reconsideration of their previously filed \napplication, without an additional application fee. That regulation \nallows IV applicants to have their case reconsidered, without payment \nof an additional fee, by providing ``further evidence tending to \novercome the ground of ineligibility on which the refusal was based'' \nwithin one year of the date of refusal. The Department considers Proc. \n10141, issued January 20, 2021, as the presentation of evidence \novercoming the ineligibility, thus allowing cases refused within the \nprior year to be reconsidered under 22 CFR 42.81(e) without a new \napplication fee.\n    Proc. 10141 described Proc. 9645/9983 as ``just plain wrong.'' As a \nmeans of remedying a suspension of entry under Proc. 9645/9983 that the \nPresident found objectional as explained in Proc. 10141, the Department \nexempts, from payment of immigrant visa fees, applicants who were \ndenied an IV on or between December 8, 2017, and January 19, 2020, \nsolely due to the Proc. 9645/9983 and who submits a new application for \nan immigrant visa. Specifically, under this rule, these individuals \nwould be exempt from the applicable immigrant visa application \nprocessing fee, as well as the affidavit of support review fee, if the \napplicant would otherwise be required to pay that fee again.\n\nIII. Regulatory Findings and Impact Statements\n\nA. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rule is exempt from notice and comment under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) because it involves a foreign \naffairs function of the United States. 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).\n    Article II of the Constitution endows the President with certain \nforeign affairs powers, including the power to regulate the entry of \nnoncitizens to the United States. See U.S. CONST. art. II; United \nStates ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 542 (1950) (``The \nexclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty . . . [and] is \ninherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the \nnation.''); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 588-89 (1952) \n(``[A]ny policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven \nwith contemporaneous policies in regard to the conduct of foreign \nrelations [and] the war power . . . .''). An agency action that is \ntaken as an extension of the President's Article II foreign affairs \nauthority is a diplomatic function and falls within the foreign affairs \nexception (hereafter, the ``exception''). See East Bay Sanctuary \nCovenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 755 (9th Cir. 2018) (noting that \nArticle II ``vests power in the President to regulate the entry of \naliens into the United States,'' and are inherent executive powers that \nconstitute a foreign affairs function (citing Knauff, 338 U.S. at \n542)). Visa functions specifically involve regulating the admission or \nexclusion of noncitizens. Therefore,\n\n[[Page 2704]]\n\nvisa-related regulations involve executing a constitutionally-bestowed \nExecutive power. See Knauff, 338 U.S. at 542. Any visa-related \nregulations then fall within the exception as an extension of the \nPresident's foreign affairs functions.\n    An action will fall within the foreign affairs exception if it \n``clearly and directly'' involves a foreign affairs function. Capital \nArea Immigrants' Rights Coal. v. Trump, 471 F. Supp. 3d 25, 53 (D.D.C. \n2020) (``to be covered by the foreign affairs function exception, a \nrule must clearly and directly involve activities or actions \ncharacteristic to the conduct of international relations''). In Raoof \nv. Sullivan, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found \nthat the Department properly exercised the foreign affairs exception \nfor the J-1 nonimmigrant visa two-year foreign residence requirement \nbecause ``the exchange visitor program--with its statutory mandate for \ninternational interaction through nonimmigrants--certainly relates to \nforeign affairs and diplomatic duties conferred upon the Secretary of \nState and the State Department.'' 315 F. Supp. 3d 34, 44 (D.D.C. 2018). \nAs in Raoof, this rule reflects changes to U.S. foreign policy, \nspecifically in the context of U.S. visas. In waiving certain fees for \nparticular visa applicants, this rule will allow the Department to \nbetter facilitate immigration of foreign nationals to the United \nStates, which clearly and directly relates to a foreign affairs \nfunction of the United States.\n    Given the Department's responsibility for carrying out U.S. foreign \npolicy, which includes the issuance of visas, and the Department's \ndiscretionary authority to collect visa fees, the Department may exempt \ncategories of foreign nationals from payment of fees for an immigrant \nvisa application. Fees are frequently a central discussion area in \nbilateral and multilateral consular engagements and have at times \nbecome a profound diplomatic irritant. What fees we do or do not charge \na given country's citizens will directly affect the fees charged to \nAmericans who wish to visit that country. The Department spends \nconsiderable time on this issue, and on ensuring reciprocal treatment \nfor American citizens. Visa fees have a direct diplomatic effect on our \nrelationship with other countries. The Secretary's exercise of a \ndiscretionary authority to publicly identify which categories of \nforeign immigrants are not required to pay immigrant visa application \nfees, particularly when foreign nationality is a determinant and \nreciprocal treatment at issue, clearly and directly impact foreign \naffairs functions of the United States and implicates matters of \ndiplomacy directly. Consequently, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \n553(a)(1), is exempt from the notice and comment requirement of 5 \nU.S.C. 553.\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272 (Small Business)\n\n    As this rulemaking is not subject to notice-and-comment \nrequirements, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.\n\nC. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UFMA), \nPublic Law 104-4, 109 Stat. 48, 2 U.S.C. 1532, generally requires \nagencies to prepare a statement before proposing any rule that may \nresult in an annual expenditure of $100 million or more by State, \nlocal, or tribal governments, or by the private section. This rule will \nnot result in any such expenditure, nor will it significantly or \nuniquely affect small governments.\n\nD. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)\n\n    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has designated this rule \na ``significant regulatory action,'' although not economically \nsignificant, under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, \nthe rule has been reviewed by OMB.\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public \nhealth and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). The \nDepartment has reviewed this proposal to ensure consistency with those \nrequirements.\n    The Department has also considered this rule in light of Executive \nOrder 13563 and affirms that this rule is consistent with the guidance \ntherein.\n\nE. Executive Orders 12372 and 13132 (Federalism)\n\n    This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, \non the relationship between the National Government and the States, or \nthe distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels \nof government. Nor will the rule have federalism implications \nwarranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and 13132.\n\nF. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform)\n\n    The Department has reviewed the rule in light of sections 3(a) and \n3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, minimize \nlitigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce burden.\n\nG. Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments)\n\n    The Department has determined that this rule will not have tribal \nimplications, will not impose substantial direct compliance costs on \nIndian tribal governments, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to \nthis rule.\n\nH. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35.\n\nI. Congressional Review Act\n\n    This final rule is not a major rule as defined by the Congressional \nReview Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Parts 22 and 42\n\n    Consular services, Fees, Immigration, Passports and visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, and under the \nauthority 8 U.S.C. 1104 and 22 U.S.C. 2651(a), 22 CFR parts 22 and 42 \nare amended as follows:\n\nPART 22--SCHEDULE OF FEES FOR CONSULAR SERVICES--DEPARTMENT OF \nSTATE AND FOREIGN SERVICE\n\n0\n1.

Section 42.71 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as \nfollows:\n\n\nSec.  42.71  Authority to issue visas; visa fees.\n\n* * * * *\n    (b) Immigrant visa fees--(1) Payment of fees. The Secretary of \nState prescribes a fee for the processing of immigrant visa \napplications. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this \nsection, an individual registered for immigrant visa processing at a \npost designated for this purpose by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nVisa Services must pay the fee upon being notified that a visa is \nexpected to become available in the near future, and upon being \nrequested to obtain the supporting documentation needed to apply \nformally for a visa, in accordance with instructions received with such \nnotification. The fee must be paid before an applicant at a post so \ndesignated will receive an appointment to appear and make application \nbefore a consular officer. Applicants at a post not yet so designated \nwill pay the fee immediately prior to formal application for a visa. A \nfee collected for the processing of an immigrant visa application is \nrefundable only if the principal officer of a post or the officer in \ncharge of a consular section determines that the application was not \nadjudicated as a result of action by the U.S. Government over which the \nalien had no control and for which the alien was not responsible, which \nprecluded the applicant from benefitting from the processing, or as \nprovided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.\n    (2) Waiver or refund of fees for replacement immigrant visas for \nadoptees. The consular officer shall waive the application processing \nfee for a replacement immigrant visa or, upon request, refund such a \nfee where already paid, if the consular officer is satisfied that the \nalien, the alien's parent(s), or the alien's representative has \nestablished that:\n    (i) The prior immigrant visa was issued on or after March 27, 2013, \nto an alien who has been lawfully adopted, or who is coming to the \nUnited States to be adopted, by a United States citizen;\n    (ii) The alien was unable to use the original immigrant visa during \nthe period of its validity as a direct result of extraordinary \ncircumstances, including the denial of an exit permit; and\n    (iii) The inability to use the visa was attributable to factors \nbeyond the control of the adopting parent or parents and of the alien.\n    (3) Exemption from fees for immigrant visa applicants previously \nrefused solely pursuant to Proclamation 9645 or Proclamation 9983. An \nimmigrant visa applicant shall be exempt from the application \nprocessing fee and the affidavit of support review fee, if the \napplicant was previously denied an immigrant visa on or between \nDecember 8, 2017, and January 19, 2020; the sole ground of \nineligibility was based on Proclamation 9645 or 9983; and the applicant \nis applying again for an immigrant visa. This paragraph (b)(3) provides \nonly for a one-time exemption of the applicable fees per applicant.\n\n0\n5. Section 42.74 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as \nfollows:\n\n\nSec.  42.74   Issuance of new, replacement, or duplicate visas.\n\n    (a) New immigrant visa for a special immigrant under INA \n101(a)(27)(A) and (B). The consular officer may issue a new immigrant \nvisa to a qualified alien entitled to status under INA 101(a)(27)(A) or \n(B), provided that:\n    (1) The alien establishes that the original visa has been lost, \nmutilated, or has expired; or that the alien will be unable to use it \nduring the period of its validity; and\n    (2) The alien pays anew the application processing fees prescribed \nin the Schedule of Fees (22 CFR 22.1); and\n    (3) The consular officer ascertains whether the original issuing \noffice knows of any reason why a new visa should not be issued.\n* * * * *\n\nKevin E.

    "supplementary_information": "The Department has identified a regulation \nrelating to defunct immigrant visa classifications for certain former \nU.S. citizens that is unnecessary. As a result of Section 3 of the Act \nof March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1228, some U.S. citizen women lost their \nUnited States citizenship as a result of a marriage prior September 22, \n1922. This provision was repealed by the Cable Act of 1922, 42 Stat. \n1022.\n    Between 1907 and 1922, some U.S. citizen women lost their U.S. \ncitizenship due to their marriage to an alien, or to a U.S. citizen who \nacquired another citizenship. Department regulations at 22 CFR 42.23(a) \ndescribed an immigrant visa classification that was available to such \nwomen. The last visa issued in this category was issued in 1998, and it \nis unlikely that any person eligible for this category is still living. \nTherefore, the Department is removing this unnecessary regulation.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rule is issued without prior notice and opportunity to \ncomment, with an immediate effective date, pursuant to the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d). Under 5 \nU.S.C. 553(b)(B), agencies are exempt from notice and comment \nrulemaking when an agency finds for good cause that ``notice and public \nprocedures are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest.'' The APA also authorizes agencies to dispose of a 30-day \ndelay in effective date and make a rule effective immediately upon a \nshowing of good cause. 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). The Department finds that \ngood cause exists both to waive prior notice and comment and the 30-day \ndelay of effective date on this rule because both are unnecessary. The \nlast visa issued within this category was in 1998, and it is unlikely \nthat eligible invdividualsindividuals are still living, making this \nrule both outdated and unnecessary. As a result, removal of this rule \nis insignificant in nature and impact, and inconsequential to the \npublic. Therefore, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d), this \nrule is effective immediately and is not subject to the notice-and-\ncomment rule making procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 553.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    Because this final rule is exempt from notice and comment \nrulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the regulatory \nflexibility analysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604).\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and \ntribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 \nmillion or more in any year and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 804, for \npurposes of congressional review of agency rulemaking under the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. This rule will \nnot result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; \na major increase in costs or prices; or adverse effects on competition, \nemployment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of \nUnited States-based companies to compete with foreign-based companies \nin domestic and import markets.\n\nExecutive Order 12866 and 13771: Reducing Regulation and Controlling \nRegulatory Costs\n\n    The Department does not consider this rule to be a ``significant \nregulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), \nRegulatory Planning and Review. The Department has nevertheless \nreviewed the regulation to ensure its consistency with the regulatory \nphilosophy and principles set forth in that Executive Order with the \nguidance therein. This rule withdraws defunct regulations and will not \nimpose any costs on the public. This rule is an E.O. 13771 deregulatory \naction.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132: Federalism\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Nor will the rule have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nExecutive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not preempt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rulemaking does not impose or revise any reporting or record-\nkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. \nchapter 35.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Aliens, Immigrants, Passports, Visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, 22 CFR part \n42 is amended as follows:\n\nPART 42--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION \nAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.

The statute provides \nthat the Secretary of State may choose to approve such a recommendation \nafter finding that it is in the national interest to grant such status, \nfor the status to be conferred. Upon notification that the Secretary of \nState, or designee, has approved a recommendation and found that \ngranting special immigrant status is in the national interest, the \napplicant must submit a completed Form DS-1884, Petition to Classify \nSpecial Immigrant Under INA 203(b)(4) as an Employee or Former Employee \nof the U.S. Government Abroad, to the Department of State \n(``Department'') within one year. Once the DS-1884 is submitted and \napproved, the employee must submit an immigrant visa application, which \na consular officer adjudicates in accordance with relevant provisions \nin the INA. If the consular officer approves the visa application and \nissues the visa, the applicant then has six months to immigrate to the \nUnited States. To avoid potential confusion, the Department emphasizes \nthat this regulation affects only the granting of special immigrant \nstatus to long term employees of the U.S. government abroad under INA \nsection 101(a)(27)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(D); this regulation does \nnot affect the granting of special immigrant status under any of the \nauthorities for special immigrant status, including any of the other \nprovisions in INA section 101(a)(27), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27), or those \nspecific to nationals of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n    This rule codifies the circumstances that will be considered \n``exceptional'' for purposes of assessing special immigrant status \nqualification. The scope of ``exceptional circumstances'' set out in \nthis rule departs, in certain respects, from the Department's policies \nthat preceded this rule, which were articulated only in the Foreign \nAffairs Manual (FAM), specifically 9 FAM 502.5-3(C)(2)(d), not in the \nCFR. Specifically, the excluded criteria, formerly in 9 FAM 502.5-\n3(C)(2)(d)(3)(c)(ii)-(vi), that will no longer constitute exceptional \ncircumstances, are: Recognition with multiple individual awards; high \nvisibility in a sensitive position; control over key aspects of the \noperations or overall functioning of a Foreign Service post; valuable \nservices and assistance to the U.S. community at post apart from \nperformance of official duties; and faithful service in a country \nforeign to the employee that resulted in the employee losing economic \nand social ties to his or her home country. The regulation also adds \ntwo new criteria that will constitute exceptional circumstances moving \nforward, specifically: Recognition with a ``Foreign Service National of \nthe Year'' award; and disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, or other \nissues that result in significant action against an offending party. \nThe FAM will be revised in accordance with this rule on the effective \ndate of this rule.\n    The rule also makes several technical and organizational edits to \n22 CFR 42.32. This rule moves relevant portions of 22 CFR 42.32(d)(2) \non special immigrant status (specific to INA section 101(a)(27)(D), 8 \nU.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(d)) into a new section, 22 CFR 42.34; and 22 CFR \n42.32(d)(2) is amended to include a cross reference to 22 CFR 42.34. \nThe new 22 CFR 42.34 expands upon the application process and the \nqualifications for special immigrant status, and more clearly organizes \nthese topics.\n    This rule also eliminates 22 CFR 42.32(d)(2)(ii), Special immigrant \nstatus for certain aliens employed at the United States mission in Hong \nKong, because the window to apply for special immigrant status under \nthis section closed on January 1, 2002. The remaining provisions of 22 \nCFR 42.32(d)(2), including 22 CFR\n\n[[Page 36324]]\n\n42.32(d)(2)(i) and 22 CFR 42.32(d)(2)(iii)-(vi), are revised and moved \nto 22 CFR 42.34 and consolidated with current guidance drawn from 9 FAM \n502.5-3. Sections 42.32(d)(2)(i)(A) and (C) are moved to section \n42.34(b), and the Department has revised the description of \naccompanying or following-to-join spouses and children to more \nprecisely align with INA section 203(d), 8 U.S.C. 1153(d). The \ndescription of following-to-join spouses and children that is being \nsuperseded by this rule had stated they were ``entitled to a derivative \nstatus corresponding to the classification and priority date of the \nbeneficiary of the petition.'' This language has been amended to remove \nreference to ``derivative status'' to more accurately reflect INA \nsection 203(d), 8 U.S.C. 1153(d), which states that such spouses and \nchildren if not otherwise entitled to an immigrant status and the \nimmediate issuance of a visa, are entitled to the same classification \nand priority date of the beneficiary of the petition. Text formerly in \nsection 42.32(d)(2)(i)(B) is now consolidated with the definition of \n``qualifying full-time service'' in section 42.34(c)(1).\n    In the definitions section, the rule clarifies what is meant by \nfulfilling 15 years of qualifying full-time service, explaining that it \ncan be achieved in a number of ways. For example, working full-time for \n10 years and half-time for at least 10 more would qualify the employee \nfor consideration.\n    The rule also codifies a definition of ``faithful service,'' which \nis a statutory requirement for special immigrant status under INA \nsection 101(a)(27)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(D). This definition \nreflects longstanding Department practice and guidance on what \nconstitutes ``faithful service,'' and the responsibility of the \nprincipal officer to determine that the alien's service has been \nfaithful. Department guidance that preceded this rule, and will \ncontinue, instructs principal officers at foreign service post to \nconsider employees' disciplinary records and other similar factors in \nmaking this assessment.\n    The Department has also incorporated into the regulation, with some \nchanges, guidance at 9 FAM 502.5-3(C)(2)(d)(3)(a)(iii) since March 27, \n2019, explaining that ``exceptional circumstances'' includes situations \nwhere the United States and the host country have strained relations \nand the employee may be subjected to persecution or pressure to divulge \ninformation. Because the term ``persecution,'' as defined in certain \nother U.S. legal contexts, does not accurately reflect the Department's \npolicy relative to finding exceptional circumstances for this special \nimmigrant status, the regulation adopts a standard of ``retribution,'' \nto more accurately reflect the Department's policy and practice in this \narea. The Department does not anticipate this change in terminology \nwill affect the application of this exceptional circumstance provision, \nbecause the Department, for the purposes of this provision, has \nhistorically considered conduct to be ``persecution'' within the \nmeaning of the FAM guidance, as amended, despite not necessarily \nmeeting the elements of ``persecution'' as defined in other contexts, \nsuch as in the asylum context, and as informed by the Board of \nImmigration Appeals and opinions by the Attorney General. Since the \ninception of this program, as a matter of policy, the Department has \nviewed 20 or more years of faithful service as prima facie evidence of \n``exceptional circumstances,'' because the employee has devoted such a \nlarge portion of his or her career to the U.S. government. This rule \nretains that understanding.\n    Section 42.32(d)(2)(iii) is now Sec.  42.34(b)(2). The last \nsentence from 22 CFR 42.32(d)(2)(iv), stating ``In cases described in \nSec.  42.33(d)(2)(ii), the validity of the petition shall not in any \ncase extend beyond January 1, 2002'' is not included in this rule, \nbecause it no longer applies.\n    This rule makes technical, but non-substantive changes to the text \npreviously in Sec.  42.32(d)(2)(v), and now in Sec.  42.32(b)(5). \nFirst, the rule adds ``or designee's'' after ``Secretary of State,'' \nand removes the ``'s'' after ``Secretary of State.'' This rule also re-\nphrases the former reference to the Secretary of State's ``approval of \nspecial immigrant status'' to ``approval of the principal officer's \nrecommendation'' for consistency with other references in this rule. \nAdditional reorganization includes moving Sec.  42.32(d)(2)(iv) to \nSec.  42.34(b)(4); Sec.  42.32(d)(2)(vi) to Sec.  42.34(b)(1); and \nSec.  42.32(d)(2)(vii) to Sec.  42.34(b)(3).\n\nWhat law or directive authorizes the rulemaking?\n\n    Pursuant to INA section 104(a), 8 U.S.C. 1104(a), the Secretary of \nState may establish regulations necessary for the administration of the \nINA. INA section 101(a)(27)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(D), provides for \nthe granting of special immigrant status in exceptional circumstances \nto immigrants who are employees, or honorably retired former employees, \nof the U.S. government abroad, or of the American Institute in Taiwan, \nand who have performed faithful service for at least 15 years, as well \nas their accompanying spouse and children. Further, INA section \n101(a)(27)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)(D), provides that the Secretary of \nState must approve each recommendation and find that it is in the \nnational interest to grant special immigrant status. INA section \n203(b)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(4), allocates visas to be made available to \nqualified special immigrants each fiscal year.\n\nWhat problem does the rulemaking address, and how does this rulemaking \naddress it?\n\n    Until now, Department regulations have not addressed the criteria \nused by the Department in implementing statutory eligibility standards \nfor special immigrant status. Certain criteria that were included in \nVolume 9 of the FAM were subjective or otherwise led to inconsistency \nin recommendations submitted by different overseas posts. This likely \nresulted in uncertainty for special immigrant status applicants and, \npotentially, inconsistent results for similarly situated applicants. \nThe Department is revising the eligibility criteria to exclude the most \nsubjective of criteria and adding new objective bases for establishing \nexceptional circumstances. The Department aims to promote consistency \nin adjudications of applications for special immigrant status. \nCodifying these objective criteria is intended to increase the \nlikelihood that similar service is rewarded similarly around the world \nand increase the fairness and integrity of the special immigrant status \nprocess through more consistent application of the law. These \ntransparent standards will aid the U.S. government abroad in recruiting \nand retaining loyal and committed foreign nationals.\n\nHow will the Department implement this rule?\n\n    There is a six-month delay in the effective date of this rule for \nthe Department to continue the orderly adjudication of cases that are \nready or nearly ready for consideration by the principal officer or the \nSecretary, or designee. The new standards will apply to all \nrecommendations from the principal officer of a Foreign Service \nestablishment submitted to the Department for consideration by the \nSecretary of State, or designee, on or after the effective date. The \nDepartment considers a recommendation to be submitted when the \nDepartment has received the principal officer's recommendation through \nthe proper submission methods from post. This rulemaking provides \nprospective applicants seeking to qualify under INA section \n101(a)(27)(D), 8 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page 36325]]\n\n1101(a)(27)(D), for special immigrant status notice regarding the \nDepartment's implementation of the program.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rule relates to a foreign affairs function, and consequently, \nin accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1), it is not subject to the notice-\nand-comment rule making procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 553. This rule \naffects the U.S. government's ability to recruit and retain locally \nemployed staff for its overseas missions. It also clearly and directly \nimpacts foreign affairs functions of the United States and \n``implicat[es] matters of diplomacy directly.'' City of N.Y. v. \nPermanent Mission of India to the U.N., 618 F.3d 172, 202 (2d Cir. \n2010).\n    This rule involves the Secretary of State's authority to determine \nthat it is in the national interest to grant special immigrant status \nto a current or former employee of the U.S. government, a determination \nthat involves a wide range of foreign affairs considerations and \nfunctions, including the U.S. government's bilateral relationship with \nthe host country, the impact on the U.S. government's ability to \nrecruit qualified personnel in the country, and the impact of special \nimmigrant status availability on the willingness of foreign nationals \nto become, and remain as, employees of the U.S. government.\n    Special immigrant status eligibility is critical for the U.S. \ngovernment to recruit and retain loyal, valuable local staff outside \nthe United States, without which the Department could not efficiently \nfunction overseas. The Department alone employs approximately 50,000 \nlocal staff at over 200 Foreign Service posts overseas, excluding local \nstaff employed on behalf of all the other U.S. government agencies \noperating overseas, for which we lack data.\\1\\ Because special \nimmigrant status is only available to locally employed staff with at \nleast fifteen years of faithful service, and under exceptional \ncircumstances, potential eligibility encourages employees to remain in \ntheir jobs and to provide long-term, institutional memory to U.S. \ngovernment agencies abroad. This is particularly essential in countries \nwhere local staff members face retribution by the host government, \nmaking it even more challenging to recruit and retain a locally \nemployed workforce. The potential for locally employed staff to obtain \nspecial immigrant status for their spouses and children, in particular, \nis central to the U.S. government's ability to recruit and retain loyal \nand committed foreign nationals to support U.S. missions overseas. \nConsequently, the approval of recommendations for special immigrant \nstatus, and the promulgation of standards for such approval under the \nSecretary of State's authority in INA section 101(a)(27)(D), 8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)(27)(D), involve foreign affairs functions of the Department of \nState.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Corey R Gill, U.S. Department of State Personnel: Background \nand Selected Issues for Congress, Congressional Research Service, 15 \n(May 18, 2018).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    Because this rule is exempt from notice and comment rulemaking \nunder 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the regulatory flexibility \nanalysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 \nU.S.C. 603 and 604). Nonetheless, consistent with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Department certifies that this \nrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial \nnumber of small entities.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. \n1532, generally requires agencies to prepare a statement before \nproposing any rule that may result in an annual expenditure of $100 \nmillion or more by State, local, or tribal governments, or by the \nprivate sector. This rule will not result in any such expenditure, nor \nwill it significantly or uniquely affect small governments.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\n    The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined \nthat this rule is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\n\nExecutive Order 12866, 13563, and 13771\n\n    The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined \nthat this is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order \n12866 and has reviewed this document. The Department has also reviewed \nthis rulemaking to ensure its consistency with the regulatory \nphilosophy and principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. The \nDepartment has also considered this rule in light of Executive Order \n13563 and affirms that this regulation is consistent with the guidance \ntherein. This regulation is de minimis under Executive Order 13771.\n    This regulation is being promulgated to avoid unfair variation in \nthe administration of the special immigrant status program and to \nensure consistent application of certain provisions of immigration law \nto principal officer recommendations for special immigrant status at \nU.S. foreign missions around the world. The Department estimates that \napproximately 60 recommendations from a principal officer per year may \nbe initially impacted by this rule, because an employee's \nqualifications will not demonstrate the requisite exceptional \ncircumstances to qualify for special immigrant status due to the \nchanges in standards implemented through this rule. The Department is \nunable to reliably estimate the number of dependents who may also be \nrestricted in their ability to qualify for derivative status until \ntheir spouse or parent is recommended by a principal officer under this \nnew rule. Assuming an average of 2 derivatives per principal applicant, \nthe rule could affect approximately 180 people worldwide per year. The \nDepartment derived the estimate of affected principal officer \nrecommendations from recent data regarding applicants who previously \nqualified for this program under the exceptional circumstances that are \nbeing removed or changed under this rule.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ Specifically, the Department analyzed a sample of cases \nreviewed from June 2018 to March 2019. Of the 508 principal officer \nrecommendations reviewed during that 10-month period, 50 qualified \nfor this program solely based on the categories of exceptional \ncircumstances that are being removed or changed. The volume of \napplications reviewed during this period was consistent with \nhistorical precedent. Based on this sample, the Department estimates \nthat approximately five potential principal officer recommendations \nper month, or 60 per year, will not be eligible for special \nimmigrant status but may have been eligible under the previous \neligibility criteria. However, the Department has no way to \nanticipate the number of aliens who might qualify in the future \nunder the new categories of exceptional circumstances created in \nthis regulation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The majority of the affected principal officer recommendations \nrelated to employee qualifications each year are likely to be delayed \nrather than permanently eliminated, as there are several other \ncircumstances through which employees may receive principal officer \nrecommendations and qualify for special immigrant status in the future. \nFor example, some principal officer recommendations for applicants with \nat least 15 years of service, but less than 20 years of service, could \npreviously qualify under the grounds of receiving at least two \nindividual honor awards. This rule eliminates this category of \nexceptional circumstance. However, these same principal officer \nrecommendations may still qualify under a separate exceptional \ncircumstance in the future by reaching 20 years of service. As a \nresult, while an\n\n[[Page 36326]]\n\nestimated 60 recommendations from principal officers regarding the \nqualification of applicants may be affected, the Department does not \nexpect that a significant number of principal officer recommendations \nwill be permanently affected.\n    The Department notes that there is a possibility that this rule may \nmake it more difficult to hire foreign workers; however, as this \nprogram will remain intact and the effect is more likely to delay \nrather than eliminate eligibility, the Department expects this impact \nto be minimal. The Department will incur de minimis administrative \ncosts to provide clear guidance and messaging regarding this change to \nall posts and to locally employed staff that may be impacted by the \nrule. While some locally employed staff may believe a principal officer \nwould likely recommend them for special immigrant status on bases \neliminated by this rule, there are several other categories, as \ndiscussed above, through which they may qualify in the future.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132: Federalism\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. The rule will not have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nExecutive Order 12988: Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed the regulation in light of sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburden.\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    Special immigrant status applicants complete the DS-1884 (OMB \nControl Number 1405-0082) and the DS-260 (OMB Control Number 1405-0185) \nafter the Secretary, or designee, approves the recommendation from the \nprincipal officer. This rule has no effect on the DS-1884 or the cost \nburdens for individual applicants completing these forms. Rather, this \nrule applies to the adjudication standards applied internally by the \nDepartment's personnel. The Department believes this rule may initially \nreduce the overall number of DS-1884, Petition to Classify Special \nImmigrant Under INA 203(b)(4), by approximately 60 per year due to a \ndecrease either in the number of principal officer recommendations \nsubmitted to the Department or the number of recommendations approved \nby the Secretary, or his designee. However, many of the affected \napplicants will likely eventually qualify and file both the form DS-\n1884 and DS-260. Because this rule is likely to delay, rather than \nprevent, most affected applicants from completing these forms, the \nDepartment does not believe that this proposal will affect the burden \nof these forms.\n    The Department estimates a related reduction in the overall number \nof immigrant visa applications on form DS-260 by approximately 180 per \nyear, based on the past average of approximately two derivative family \nmembers per applicant for this applicant pool. The Department is unable \nto reliably estimate the number of dependents of affected applicants \nfor special immigrant status who will not file a DS-260, if the \nprincipal subsequently is approved for SIV status, because, e.g., they \nwill age out of dependent eligibility or they will be unable or \nunwilling to wait.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Aliens, Immigration, Passports and Visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, the \nDepartment of State amends 22 CFR part 42 as follows:\n\nPART 42 VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION \nAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.

Add Sec.  42.34 to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  42.34  Special immigrant visas--certain U.S. Government \nemployees.\n\n    (a) General. (1) An alien is classifiable under INA 203(b)(4) as a \nspecial immigrant described in INA 101(a)(27)(D) provided:\n    (i) The alien has performed faithful service to the United States \nGovernment abroad, or of the American Institute in Taiwan, for a total \nof fifteen years, or more;\n    (ii) The principal officer of a Foreign Service establishment (or, \nin the case of the American Institute in Taiwan, the Director), \nrecommends granting special immigrant status to such alien in \nexceptional circumstances;\n    (iii) The Secretary of State, or designee, approves such \nrecommendation and finds that it is in the national interest to grant \nsuch status.\n    (b) Petition requirement. An alien who seeks classification as a \nspecial immigrant under INA 203(b)(4) based on service as an employee \nto the U.S. government abroad or American Institute in Taiwan must file \na Form DS-1884, Petition to Classify Special Immigrant under INA \n203(b)(4) as an Employee or Former Employee of the U.S. Government \nAbroad, with the Department of State. An alien may file such a petition \nonly after, but within one year of, notification from the Department \nthat the Secretary of State or designee has approved a recommendation \nfrom the principal officer that special immigrant status be accorded \nthe alien in exceptional circumstances, and has found it in the \nnational interest to do so.\n    (1) Petition fees. The Secretary of State shall establish a fee for \nthe filing of a petition to accord status under INA 203(b)(4) which \nshall be collected following notification that the Secretary of State, \nor designee, has approved the recommendation that the alien be granted \nstatus as a special immigrant under INA 101(a)(27)(D).\n    (2) Establishing priority date. The priority date of an alien \nseeking status under INA 203(b)(4) as a special immigrant described in \n101(a)(27)(D) shall be the date on which the petition\n\n[[Page 36327]]\n\nto accord such classification, the DS-1884, is filed. The filing date \nof the petition is the date on which a properly completed form and the \nrequired fee are accepted by a Foreign Service post. Pursuant to INA \n203(d), and whether or not named in the petition, the spouse or child \nof an alien classified under INA 203(b)(4), if not otherwise entitled \nto an immigrant status and the immediate issuance of a visa, is \nentitled to the classification and priority date of the beneficiary of \nthe petition.\n    (3) Delegation of authority to approve petitions. The authority to \napprove petitions to accord status under INA 203(b)(4) to an alien \ndescribed in INA 101(a)(27)(D) is hereby delegated to the chief \nconsular officer at the post of recommendation or, in the absence of \nthe consular officer, to any alternate approving officer designated by \nthe principal officer. Such authority may not be exercised until the \nForeign Service post has received formal notification of the Secretary \nof State or designee's approval of special immigrant status for the \npetitioning alien.\n    (4) Petition validity. Except as noted in this paragraph, the \nvalidity of a petition approved for classification under INA 203(b)(4) \nshall be six months beyond the date of the Secretary of State's \napproval thereof or the availability of a visa number, whichever is \nlater.\n    (5) Extension of special immigrant status and petition validity. If \nthe principal officer of a post concludes that circumstances in a \nparticular case are such that an extension of validity of the Secretary \nof State or designee's approval of the principal officer's \nrecommendation or of the petition would be in the national interest, \nthe principal officer shall recommend to the Secretary of State or \ndesignee that such validity be extended for not more than one \nadditional year.\n    (c) Definitions--(1) Full-time service. An alien must have been \nemployed for a total of at least 15 full-time years, or the equivalent \nthereof, in the service of the U.S. government abroad. The number of \nhours per week that qualify an employee as full-time is dependent on \nlocal law and prevailing practice in the country where the alien is or \nwas employed, as reflected in the employment documentation submitted \nwith the application for special immigrant status. An alien may qualify \nas a special immigrant under INA 101(a)(27)(D) on the basis of \nemployment abroad with one or more than one agency of the U.S. \ngovernment provided the total amount of full-time service with the U.S. \ngovernment is 15 years or more, or the equivalent thereof.\n    (2) Faithful service. An alien must have performed faithfully in \nthe position held. The principal officer has the primary responsibility \nfor determining whether the alien's service meets this requirement. A \nrecord of disciplinary actions that have been taken against the alien \ndoes not automatically disqualify the alien. The principal officer must \nassess the disciplinary action in light of the extent and gravity of \nthe misconduct and when it occurred and determine whether the record as \na whole, notwithstanding disciplinary actions, is one of faithful \nservice.\n    (3) Continuity. The alien's period of service need not have been \ncontinuous.\n    (4) Abroad. The service must have occurred anywhere outside the \nUnited States, as the term ``United States'' is defined in INA \n101(a)(38).\n    (5) Employment at the American Institute in Taiwan.

    "supplementary_information": "This proposed rule implements the Freedom of \nInformation Act (FOIA) Improvement Act of 2016, Public Law 114-185, and \nupdates the Department's FOIA regulations at 22 CFR part 171. The \nfollowing is a summary of the substantive changes.\n    The proposed rule, in Sec.  171.4, provides updated procedures and \naddresses for submitting FOIA requests to the Department, including \nprocedures for requesting information about the requester and requests \nfor visa information.\n    Subpart B of the proposed rule (Sec.  171.10 through Sec.  171.17) \ncontains the rules governing the processing of a FOIA request. Proposed \nSec.  171.11 covers the Department's initial processing of a request; \nit clarifies the information that is to be provided as part of a \nrequest, the Department's process for responding to requests, and \nconsultation and referral with respect to requests. Proposed Sec.  \n171.12 covers the timing of responses to a request, including multi-\ntrack processing, expedited processing, and ``unusual circumstances'' \n(as defined in the FOIA) that might affect the Department's ability to \nrespond. Proposed Sec.  171.13 covers responses to requests, including \nthe procedures upon denial of a request. The proposed updates add a \nprovision for consultation with the Department of Justice's Office of \nInformation Policy with respect to invocation of a FOIA exclusion. \nProposed Sec.  171.14 modifies the Department's process with respect to \nreviews of business information, including procedures for the business \nowner of the information to object to the release of the information.\n    Proposed Sec.  171.15 revises the timeline for submission of \nappeals to 90 days and provides for information to be given to \nrequesters about dispute resolution services at various stages of the \nprocessing of a request, in accordance with the FOIA Improvement Act of \n2016. Proposed Sec.  171.16 provides updates on the fees to be charged \nfor FOIA requests, including how fees are calculated. This proposed \nsection provides an updated explanation of the term, ``representative \nof the news media.''\n    Subpart C contains the rule's Privacy Act provisions. There are \nminor changes throughout this subpart.\n\n[[Page 13105]]\n\n    In Subpart D, the proposed rule adds information about processing \nof requests for confidential financial disclosure reports.\n    Finally, the proposed rule makes numerous minor changes throughout, \nto conform more closely to the Department of Justice's Template for \nAgency FOIA Regulations.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department is publishing this rule under the provisions of 5 \nU.S.C. 553, with a 60-day public comment period.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    The Department of State, in accordance with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), has reviewed this regulation and, by \napproving it, certifies that this rule will not have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and \ntribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 \nmillion or more in any year, and it will not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary \nunder the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined by section 804 of the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. This rule \nwill not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or \nmore; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse \neffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, \ninnovation, or on the ability of United States-based companies to \ncompete with foreign-based companies in domestic and import markets.\n\nExecutive Order 12988--Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed this regulation in light of Executive \nOrder 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, minimize litigation, establish \nclear legal standards, and reduce burden.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132--Federalism\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive \nOrder 13132, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient \nfederalism implications to require consultations or warrant the \npreparation of a federalism summary impact statement. The regulations \nimplementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental \nconsultation on Federal programs and activities do not apply to this \nregulation.\n\nExecutive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to \nthis rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563--Improving Regulation and Regulatory \nReview\n\n    The Department has considered this rule in light of these Executive \nOrders and affirms that this regulation is consistent with the guidance \ntherein. The benefits of this rulemaking for the public include, but \nare not limited to, providing an up-to-date procedure for requesting \ninformation from the Department that is consistent with the FOIA \nImprovement Act of 2016. The Department is aware of no more than a \nminimal cost to the public from this rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Order 13771--Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory \nCosts\n\n    This rule is not subject to the requirements of Executive Order \n13771 because it is expected to result in no more than de minimis \ncosts.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose or revise any reporting or recordkeeping \nrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter \n35.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 171\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information, \nPrivacy.\n\n    For the reasons set forth in the preamble, revise 22 CFR part 171 \nto read as follows:\n\nPART 171--PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION\n\nSubpart A--General Policy and Procedures\nSec.\n171.1 General provisions.\n171.2 Types of records maintained.\n171.3 Records available on the Department's website.\n171.4 Requests for information--types and how made.\n171.5 Archival records.\nSubpart B--Freedom of Information Act Provisions\n171.10 Purpose and scope.\n171.11 Processing requests.\n171.12 Timing of responses to requests.\n171.13 Responses to requests.\n171.14 Business information.\n171.15 Administrative appeals.\n171.16 Fees to be charged.\n171.17 Preservation of records.\nSubpart C--Privacy Act Provisions\n171.20 Purpose and scope.\n171.21 Definitions.\n171.22 Request for access to records.\n171.23 Request to amend or correct records.\n171.24 Request for an accounting of record disclosures.\n171.25 Appeals from denials of PA amendment requests.\n171.26 Exemptions.\nSubpart D--Access to Financial Disclosure Reports\n171.30 Purpose and scope.\n171.31 Requests for Public Financial Disclosure Reports--OGE Form \n278.\n171.32 Denial of Public Access to Confidential Financial Disclosure \nReports--OGE Form 450.\n\n    Authority:  22 U.S.C. 2651a; 5 U.S.C. 552, 552a; 5 U.S.C. app. \n107(a); E.O. 12600 (52 FR 23781); Pub.

Box 1227, Sterling, \nVA 20166-1227. Requests for passport records and information that do \nnot need to be certified may also be emailed to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#104040443d4065727c79733d565f595142756165756364635063647164753e777f66\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"075757532a5772656b6e642a41484e46556276726274737447747366736229606871\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n    (3) Requests for records of the OIG must be made in writing, and \nmay be submitted via email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#25434a4c446556514451404a4c420b424a53\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"84e2ebede5c4f7f0e5f0e1ebede3aae3ebf2\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, by fax to 703-284-\n1866, or by mail addressed to FOIA Officer, Officer of General Counsel, \nOffice of Inspector General, U.S. Department of State, 1700 N. Moore \nStreet, Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22209. Submission by email is \npreferred. Guidance and contact information is available on the OIG's \nwebsite at <a href=\"http://www.stateoig.gov/foiarequest\">www.stateoig.gov/foiarequest</a>.\n    (4) The Office of Information Programs and Services, the Law \nEnforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate, and \nthe OIG are the only Department components authorized to accept FOIA \nand PA requests submitted to the Department.\n    (5) The requester should provide the specific citation to the \nauthority under which he or she is requesting information (e.g., the \nFOIA, the PA, or Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) under the \ncurrent Executive Order on classification). This will facilitate the \nprocessing of the request. When individual U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents request access to records about themselves, the \nDepartment processes responsive records maintained in Privacy Act \nsystems of records under both the FOIA and the PA to provide requesters \nwith the greatest degree of access to the records. Information in such \nrecords will be withheld only if it is exempt from access under both \nlaws; if the information is exempt under only one of the laws, it will \nbe released. Responsive records that are not maintained in a Privacy \nAct system of records are processed only under the FOIA.\n    (6) A requester who requests records about himself or herself, \nincluding passport records, must comply with the verification of \nidentity requirements as set forth in Sec.  171.22 (the Privacy Act \nProvisions) in order for the request to be processed under the PA.\n    (7) Where a request for records pertains to a third party or to a \nrequester's own records outside of a request under the Privacy Act, a \nrequester may receive greater access by submitting a notarized \nauthorization signed by the person whose records are\n\n[[Page 13107]]\n\nrequested, or by submitting a declaration made in compliance with the \nrequirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by the person whose records \nare requested, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, \nor by submitting proof that the third party is deceased (e.g., a copy \nof a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of \nadministrative discretion, the Department may require a requester to \nsupply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a \nparticular individual has consented to disclosure or is deceased.\n    (8) Requests for visa information. The Immigration and Nationality \nAct, as amended, section 222(f) (8 U.S.C. 1202(f)), provides that the \nrecords of the Department of State and of diplomatic and consular \noffices of the United States pertaining to the issuance or refusal of \nvisas or permits to enter the United States must be considered \nconfidential and shall be used only for certain enumerated purposes, \nincluding the formulation, amendment, administration, or enforcement of \nthe immigration, nationality, and other laws of the United States. As a \nresult, information subject to release in response to a request for \nvisa records about an individual may be limited. Requests for visa \nrecords should include the following information for the applicant and, \nif applicable, the petitioner: Full name, as well as any aliases used; \ncurrent address; email; and date and place of birth (including city, \nstate, and country). Additional information describing the records \nsought will assist the Department in properly identifying the \nresponsive records and in processing the request. Attorneys or other \nlegal representatives requesting visa information on behalf of a visa \napplicant should submit a statement with the request signed by the \napplicant (and the petitioner if the records sought pertain to a \npetition) authorizing release of the requested visa information to the \nrepresentative. Alternatively, requestors may submit a DS-4240 to \ncertify their identity and to provide authorization by the applicant \n(and the petitioner if the records sought pertain to a petition) to \nrelease the requested information to the legal representative. Forms \ncreated by other Federal agencies will not be accepted.\n    (b) Description of records sought. Although no particular format is \nrequired, a request must reasonably describe the Department record(s) \nthat the requester seeks. Requesters must describe the records sought \nin sufficient detail to enable agency personnel to locate them with a \nreasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should \ninclude specific information that may assist the Department in \nidentifying the requested record(s), such as the date, title or name, \nauthor, recipient, subject matter, case number, file designation \nreference number, or timeframe. If after receiving a request the \nDepartment determines that the request does not reasonably describe the \nrecords sought, the Department will inform the requester that the \nrequest is insufficient and may ask for additional information. \nRequests should also specify the records sought; failure to do so may \ndelay the agency's response. Any records provided in response to a \nrequest will be provided in the form or format requested if a \nreleasable form of the records is readily reproducible in that form or \nformat. Requesters must provide contact information, such as their \nphone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist the \nDepartment in communicating with them and providing released records.\n    (c) While the Department makes every effort to provide the greatest \npossible access to all requested records regardless of the statute(s) \nunder which the information is requested, the following guidance is \nprovided for the benefit of requesters:\n    (1) The Freedom of Information Act applies to requests for records \nconcerning the general activities of government and of the Department \nin particular (see subpart B of this part).\n    (2) The Privacy Act applies to requests from U.S. citizens or legal \npermanent resident aliens for records about them that are maintained by \nthe Department in a system of records retrievable by the individual's \nname or personal identifier (see subpart C of this part).\n\n\nSec.  171.5   Archival records.\n\n    The Department ordinarily transfers records designated as \nhistorically significant to the National Archives when they are 25 \nyears old. Accordingly, requests for some Department records 25 years \nold or older should be submitted to the National Archives by mail \naddressed to Special Access and FOIA Staff, National Archives at \nCollege Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500, College Park, MD 20740-\n6001; by fax to (301) 837-1864; or by email to \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#681b180d0b010904090b0b0d1b1b370e0701092806091a09460f071e\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"c3b0b3a6a0aaa2afa2a0a0a6b0b09ca5acaaa283ada2b1a2eda4acb5\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. The Department's website, \n<a href=\"http://www.foia.state.gov\">www.foia.state.gov</a>, has additional information regarding archival \nrecords.\n\nSubpart B--Freedom of Information Act Provisions\n\n\nSec.  171.10   Purpose and scope.\n\n    This subpart contains the rules the Department follows under the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552. The rules \nshould be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional \ninformation about access to records and contains the specific \nexemptions that are applicable for withholding information; the Uniform \nFreedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines); and information \nlocated at <a href=\"http://www.foia.state.gov\">www.foia.state.gov</a>. The Department processes requests for \nrecords maintained in a Privacy Act (PA) system of records under the \nFOIA as well. As a result, requests that seek such records are also \nsubject to this subpart.\n\n\nSec.  171.11   Processing requests.\n\n    (a) In general. (1) The Office of Information Programs and Services \n(A/GIS/IPS) is responsible for initial action on all FOIA requests for \nDepartment records, with two exceptions: Requests seeking records under \nthe purview of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), which receives \nand processes requests for OIG records (see Sec.  171.4(a)(3)); and \nrequests seeking records under the purview of the Law Enforcement \nLiaison Division of the Passport Services directorate of the Bureau of \nConsular Affairs (CA), which receives and processes requests for \ncertain consular records (see Sec.  171.4(a)(2)).\n    (2) For requests for which A/GIS/IPS is responsible for initial \naction, A/GIS/IPS will issue all initial decisions on whether a request \nis valid (or has subsequently been perfected), and whether to grant or \ndeny requests for a fee waiver or for expedited processing.\n    (3) After A/GIS/IPS takes initial action, all requests for records \ncoming under the jurisdiction of the following components are processed \nby those components, although A/GIS/IPS may provide review and \ncoordination support to these components in some situations: The Bureau \nof Consular Affairs' Directorates for Visa Services, Passport Services, \nand Overseas Citizens Services; the Bureau of Diplomatic Security; the \nBureau of Human Resources; and the Office of Medical Services. \nAdditionally, the Foreign Service Grievance Board (FSGB), as an \nindependent body, processes all FOIA requests seeking access to its \nrecords and responds directly to requesters.\n    (b) Receipt of request. The Department is in receipt of a request \nwhen it reaches A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT, depending on which office is \nthe proper recipient. At that time, the Department must send an \nacknowledgement letter to the requester that identifies the date of \nreceipt of the request in the proper office (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT), \nand the\n\n[[Page 13108]]\n\ncase tracking number. When one of these offices determines that a \nrequest was misdirected within the Department, that office must \npromptly route the request to the proper office(s) within the \nDepartment.\n    (c) Cut-off date and exclusions. In determining which records are \nresponsive to a request, the Department ordinarily will include only \nrecords in its possession as of the date of initiation of the search \nfor responsive records, unless the requester has specified an earlier \ncut-off date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the \nFOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a \nrequest.\n    (d) Consultation, referral, and coordination. When reviewing \nrecords located in response to a request, the component processing the \nrequest will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government \nis better able to determine whether the record is exempt from \ndisclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the component must \nproceed in one of the following ways:\n    (1) Consultation. When records originated with the Department, but \ncontain within them information of interest to another agency or other \nFederal Government office, the component processing the request should \ntypically consult with that other entity prior to making a release \ndetermination.\n    (2) Referral. (i) When the component processing the request \nbelieves that a different Department component or other Federal \nGovernment agency is better able to determine whether to disclose the \nrecord, the component processing the request typically should refer the \nresponsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to \nthat component or agency, as long as the referral is to an entity \nsubject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record \nwill be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. \nHowever, if the component processing the request and the originating \nagency jointly agree that the former is in the better position to \nrespond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a \nconsultation.\n    (ii) Whenever the component processing the request refers any part \nof the responsibility for responding to a request to another entity, \nthe component must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record \nthat it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the \nrequester of the name(s) of the entity to which the record was \nreferred, including that entity's FOIA contact information.\n    (3) Coordination. The standard referral procedure is not \nappropriate where disclosure of the identity of the component or agency \nto which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by \nan applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal \nprivacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law \nenforcement component responding to a request for records on a living \nthird party locates within its files records originating with a law \nenforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement \ninterest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose \nthat law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of \nthe personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if a component \nlocates within its files material originating with an Intelligence \nCommunity agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is \nclassified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give \nattribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency \ncould cause national security harm. In such instances, in order to \navoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the \ncomponent that received the request should coordinate with the \noriginating component or agency to seek its views on the whether the \nrecord may be disclosed. The release determination for the record that \nis the subject of the coordination will be conveyed to the requester by \nthe component that originally received the request.\n    (e) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All \nconsultations and referrals received by the Department will be handled \naccording to the date that the perfected FOIA request was received by \nthe first agency.\n    (f) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. The \nDepartment may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate, \nreduce, or streamline the need for consultations or referrals for \nparticular types of records.\n\n\nSec.  171.12   Timing of responses to requests.\n\n    (a) In general. The Department ordinarily will respond to requests \nin the order received. In instances involving misdirected requests that \nare re-routed pursuant to Sec.  171.11(b), the response time will \ncommence on the date that the request is received by the proper office \nthat is designated to receive requests (A/GIS/IPS, OIG or PPT), but in \nany event not later than 10 working days after the request is first \nreceived by any of these three offices.\n    (b) Multi-track processing. The Department has a specific track for \nrequests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the \nstandards that are set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. An \nintake office (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT) may also designate additional \nprocessing tracks that, for example, distinguish between simple and \nmore complex requests based on the estimated amount of work and/or time \nneeded to process the request. Among the factors that may also be \nconsidered are the number of records requested, the number of pages \ninvolved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or \nreferrals. The Department must advise requesters of the track in which \ntheir request falls and, when appropriate, should offer the requesters \nan opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a \ndifferent processing track.\n    (c) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for \nprocessing a request cannot be met because of ``unusual \ncircumstances,'' as defined in the FOIA, and the Department extends the \ntime limit on that basis, the Department must, before expiration of the \n20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the \nunusual circumstances involved. Where the extension exceeds 10 working \ndays, the Department must, as described by the FOIA, provide the \nrequester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an \nalternative time period for processing the original or a modified \nrequest. The Department must make available its designated FOIA contact \nand its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. In the written notice to \nthe requester, the Department must also alert the requester to the \navailability of the Office of Government Information Services to \nprovide dispute resolution services.\n    (d) Expedited processing. (1) The Department must process requests \nand appeals on an expedited basis whenever the Department determines \nthat:\n    (i) Failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could \nreasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or \nphysical safety of an individual;\n    (ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged \nin disseminating information, there exists an urgency to inform the \npublic concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity; or\n    (iii) Failure to release the information would impair substantial \ndue process rights or harm substantial humanitarian interests.\n    (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of \nthe initial request for records or at any later time. Requests for \nexpedited processing must be submitted to the office responsible\n\n[[Page 13109]]\n\nfor receiving the FOIA request (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT). When making a \nrequest for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the \nrequest must be submitted to A/GIS/IPS, or OIG in the case of appeals \nof OIG decisions (see Sec.  171.15). A Department FOIA office that \nreceives a misdirected request for expedited processing must forward it \npromptly to the correct office responsible for receiving requests (A/\nGIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT) for its determination. The time period for making \nthe determination on the request for expedited processing commences on \nthe date that the correct office receives the request, provided that \nthe Department will be considered to have received the request for \nexpedited processing no more than 10 working days after the request for \nexpedited processing is received by A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT.\n    (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a \nstatement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the \nbasis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, \nunder paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a \nfull-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is \na person whose primary professional activity or occupation is \ninformation dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole \noccupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency \nto inform the public about the government activity involved in the \nrequest--one that extends beyond the public's right to know about \ngovernment activity generally. The existence of numerous articles \npublished on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the \nrequirement that there be an ``urgency to inform'' the public on the \ntopic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Department may \nwaive the formal certification requirement.\n    (4) A notice of the determination whether to grant expedited \nprocessing must be provided to the requester within 10 calendar days of \nthe date of the receipt of the request for expedited processing in the \nappropriate office (whether A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT). If expedited \nprocessing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in \nthe processing track for expedited requests, and processed as soon as \npracticable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the \nDepartment must act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.\n\n\nSec.  171.13   Responses to requests.\n\n    (a) In general. The Department will, to the extent practicable, \ncommunicate with requesters having access to the internet using \nelectronic means, such as email or a web portal.\n    (b) Acknowledgment of requests. The Department must acknowledge the \nrequest in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if \nit will take longer than 10 working days to process. The Department \nmust include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records \nsought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests. \nThe Department may in its discretion divide a multi-part request into \nmultiple requests in order to facilitate processing.\n    (c) Estimated dates of completion and interim responses. Upon \nrequest, the Department will provide an estimated date by which the \nDepartment expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request \ninvolves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple \nlocations, the agency may provide interim responses, releasing the \nrecords on a rolling basis.\n    (d) Grants of requests. Once the Department makes a determination \nto grant a request in full or in part, it must notify the requester in \nwriting. The Department also must inform the requester of any fees \ncharged under Sec.  171.16 and must disclose the requested records to \nthe requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The \nDepartment must inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA \nPublic Liaison to offer assistance.\n    (e) Adverse determinations of requests. If the Department makes an \nadverse determination denying a request in any respect, it must notify \nthe requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, \nor denials of requests, include decisions that: The requested record is \nexempt from disclosure, in whole or in part; the request does not \nreasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is \nnot a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, \ncannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is \nnot readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. \nAdverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee \nwaiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.\n    (f) Content of denial. The denial must be signed by the head of the \ncomponent processing the request, or designee, and must include:\n    (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for \nthe denial;\n    (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any \nFOIA exemption applied in denying the request;\n    (3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information \nwithheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of \nestimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is \notherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed \nin part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by \nan applicable exemption; and\n    (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec.  171.15, \nand a description of the requirements set forth therein.\n    (5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available \nfrom the Department's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution \nservices offered by the Office of Government Information Services of \nthe National Archives and Records Administration.\n    (g) Markings on released documents. Markings on released documents \nmust be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part \nmust be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the \nexemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm \nan interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the \ninformation deleted must also be indicated on the record, if \ntechnically feasible.\n    (h) Use of record exclusions. (1) In the event that the Department \nidentifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the \nrequirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), A/GIS/IPS or OIG \nmust confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information \nPolicy to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.\n    (2) Any time the Department invokes an exclusion, it must maintain \nan administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of \nthe exclusion by OIP.\n\n\nSec.  171.14   Business information.\n\n    (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of \nthis section:\n    (1) Business information means commercial or financial information \nobtained by the Department from a submitter that may be exempt from \ndisclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).\n    (2) Submitter means any person or entity from which the Department \nobtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes \ncorporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships; state, local, and \ntribal governments; foreign governments, NGOs and educational \ninstitutions. This\n\n[[Page 13110]]\n\nterm does not include another Federal Government entity.\n    (b) Designation of business information. A submitter of business \ninformation must use good-faith efforts to designate by appropriate \nmarkings at the time of submission any portions of its submission that \nit considers exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4. These \ndesignations expire ten years after the date of the submission unless \nthe submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer \ndesignation period.\n    (c) Notice to submitters. (1) The Department must provide a \nsubmitter with prompt written notice whenever records containing its \nbusiness information are requested under the FOIA if the agency \ndetermines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:\n    (i) The information has been designated in good faith by the \nsubmitter as information considered exempt from disclosure under \nExemption 4; or\n    (ii) The Department has reason to believe that the requested \ninformation may be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has \nnot yet determined whether the information is protected from \ndisclosure.\n    (2) The notice must either describe the business information \nrequested or include a copy of the requested records or record portions \ncontaining the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of \nsubmitters, the Department may post or publish a notice in a place or \nmanner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed \ndisclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.\n    (d) When notice is not required. The notice requirements of this \nsection do not apply if:\n    (1) The Department determines that the information is exempt from \ndisclosure under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;\n    (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been \nofficially made available to the public;\n    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other \nthan the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the \nrequirements of Executive Order 12600; or\n    (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of \nthis section appears obviously frivolous. In such a case, the \nDepartment must give the submitter written notice of any final decision \nto disclose the information a reasonable number of days prior to a \nspecified disclosure date.\n    (e) Opportunity to object to disclosure. The Department must allow \na submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in \nparagraph (c) of this section and must specify that time period in the \nnotice. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should \nprovide the Department a detailed written statement that specifies all \ngrounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption \nof the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for \nnondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information \nconstitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that \nis privileged or confidential. In the event that a submitter fails to \nrespond to the notice within the time specified in it, the submitter \nwill be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the \ninformation. The Department is not required to consider any information \nreceived after any disclosure decision. Information provided by a \nsubmitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under \nthe FOIA.\n    (f) Notice of intent to disclose. The Department will consider a \nsubmitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in \ndeciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever the \nDepartment decides to disclose information over the objection of a \nsubmitter, it must give the submitter written notice, which must \ninclude:\n    (1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's \ndisclosure objections was not sustained;\n    (2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of \nthe records as the Department intends to release them; and\n    (3) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time \nafter the notice.\n    (g) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit \nseeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the \nDepartment must promptly notify the submitter.\n    (h) Notice to requester. The Department must notify the requester \nwhenever it provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to \nobject to disclosure; whenever it notifies a submitter of its intent to \ndisclose requested information; and whenever a submitter files a \nlawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of the requested information.\n\n\nSec.  171.15   Administrative appeals.\n\n    (a) Requirements for making an appeal. (1) Requesters may appeal \nany adverse determinations made on their FOIA request by the \nDepartment. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in Sec.  \n171.13(d). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be \nconsidered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic \nsubmissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the \nadverse determination. The appeal must clearly identify the component's \ndetermination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. \nTo facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal \nletter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, \n``Freedom of Information Act Appeal.''\n    (2) To appeal any adverse determinations made by A/GIS/IPS or a \ncomponent other than OIG, requesters must submit an administrative \nappeal to the A/GIS/IPS FOIA Appeals Office using any of the following \nmethods: By mail to the Appeals Officer, Office of Information Programs \nand Services (A/GIS/IPS), Room B-266, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C \nStreet NW, Washington, DC 20520; by fax to (202) 261-8579; or by email \nto <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#294f4640485b4c585c4c5a5d695a5d485d4c074e465f\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"43252c2a22312632362630370330372237266d242c35\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n    (3) To appeal any adverse determinations made by OIG, requesters \nmust submit an administrative appeal to OIG via email to \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb8d84828aab989f8a9f8e84828cc58c849d\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"82e4edebe3c2f1f6e3f6e7edebe5ace5edf4\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, by fax to 703-284-1866, or by mail addressed to the \nFOIA Officer, Officer of General Counsel, Office of Inspector General, \nU.S. Department of State, 1700 N Moore Street, Suite 800, Arlington, VA \n22209. Contact information for OIG is available on OIG's FOIA website \nat <a href=\"http://www.stateoig.gov/foiaappeals\">www.stateoig.gov/foiaappeals</a>. For those cases in which both A/GIS/\nIPS and OIG provided written denials to the requester, the requester \nmay administratively appeal to both A/GIS/IPS and OIG and each office \nwill handle its respective portion of the appeal.\n    (4) To appeal any adverse determinations made by the FSGB, \nrequesters must submit an administrative appeal to A/GIS/IPS using the \nmethods listed above in paragraph (2). A/GIS/IPS will assign a tracking \nnumber to the appeal and forward it to the FSGB, which is an \nindependent body, for adjudication.\n    (b) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The A/GIS/IPS Director or designee \nwill act on behalf of the Assistant Secretary for Administration on all \nappeals of A/GIS/IPS FOIA determinations under this section. Likewise, \nthe General Counsel of OIG or his/her designee will act on behalf of \nthe Inspector General on all appeals of OIG FOIA determinations under \nthis section.\n    (2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request \nbecomes a matter of FOIA litigation.\n\n[[Page 13111]]\n\n    (c) Decisions on appeals. The Department must provide its decision \non an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds the Department's \ndetermination in whole or in part must include a brief statement of the \nreason for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The \ndecision must inform the requester that the decision represents the \nfinal decision of the Department; must advise the requester of the \nstatutory right to file a lawsuit; and must inform the requester of the \ndispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government \nInformation Services of the National Archives and Records \nAdministration (OGIS) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If \na decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be \nnotified in writing. The appropriate component will then further \nprocess the request in accordance with that appeal determination and \nrespond directly to the requester.\n    (d) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS. \nDispute resolution is a voluntary process. If a component agrees to \nparticipate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it \nwill actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to \nresolve the dispute.\n    (e) When appeal is required. Before seeking review by a court of \nthe Department's adverse determination, a requester must first submit a \ntimely administrative appeal.\n\n\nSec.  171.16   Fees to be charged.\n\n    (a) In general. (1) The Department will charge fees for processing \nrequests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this \nsection and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, \nthe FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:\n    (i) Commercial use requesters,\n    (ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news \nmedia requesters, and\n    (iii) All other requesters. Different fees are assessed depending \non the category.\n    (2) Requesters may seek a fee waiver. The Department considers fee \nwaivers in accordance with the requirements set forth below. To resolve \nany issues that arise under this section, the Department may contact a \nrequester for additional information. The Department must use the most \nefficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for records \nmade under the FOIA. The Department shall attempt to notify the \nrequester if fees are estimated to exceed $25.00, unless the requester \nhas expressed a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. \nSuch notification shall include a breakdown of the fees for search, \nreview, and duplication. The Department ordinarily will collect all \napplicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. \nRequesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the \nTreasury of the United States, or by another method as determined by \nthe Department.\n    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n    (1) Commercial use request is a request that asks for information \nfor a use or purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit \ninterest, which can include furthering those interests through \nlitigation. The Department's decision to place a requester in the \ncommercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on \nthe requester's intended use of the information. The Department will \nnotify requesters of their placement in this category.\n    (2) Direct costs are those expenses the Department incurs in \nsearching for, duplicating, and, in the case of commercial use \nrequests, reviewing records in response to a FOIA request. For example, \ndirect costs include the salary of the employee performing the work \n(i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that \nrate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other \nelectronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. The term does \nnot include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of \nheating or lighting of a facility.\n    (3) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the \ninformation contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. \nCopies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic \nrecords, among others.\n    (4) Educational institution is any school that operates a program \nof scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the \nrequest is made in connection with the requester's role at the \neducational institution. The Department may seek verification from the \nrequester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research. The \nDepartment will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n    (5) Non-commercial scientific institution is an institution that is \nnot operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) \nof this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of \nconducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to \npromote any particular product or industry. A requester in this \ncategory must show that the request is authorized by and is made under \nthe auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are \nsought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. \nThe Department will advise requesters of their placement in this \ncategory.\n    (6) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that \ngathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, \nuses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct \nwork, and distributes that work to an audience. The term ``news'' means \ninformation that is about current events or that would be of current \ninterest to the public. Examples of news media entities include \ntelevision or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large \nand publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their \nproducts available through a variety of means to the general public, \nincluding news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A \nrequest for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the \nrequester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. Freelance \njournalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication \nthrough a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of \nthe news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest \nevidence that publication is expected; however, the Department shall \nalso consider a requester's past publication record in making this \ndetermination. The Department will advise requesters of their placement \nin this category.\n    (7) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a \nrequest in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from \ndisclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, \nsuch as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for \ndisclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking \nthe appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a \nrecord ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time \nspent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure \nmade by a business information submitter under Sec.  171.14 but it does \nnot include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues \nregarding the application of exemptions.\n    (8) Search is the process of looking for, identifying, and \nretrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time \nincludes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information \nwithin records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and \nretrieve information from electronic records.\n    (c) Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, the Department \nwill\n\n[[Page 13112]]\n\ncharge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been \ngranted under paragraph (j) of this section. Because the fee amounts \nprovided below already account for the direct costs associated with a \ngiven fee type, the Department should not add any additional costs to \ncharges calculated under this section.\n    (1) Search. (i) Requests made by educational institutions, non-\ncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news \nmedia are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for \nall other requesters, subject to restrictions of paragraph (j) of this \nsection. The Department may properly charge for time spent searching \neven if responsive records are not located, or if records are \ndetermined to be entirely exempt from disclosure.\n    (ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested \nrecords, the fees shall be as stated at the following website: \n<a href=\"http://foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx\">foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx</a> (section VII, ``Fees'') and \n<a href=\"http://www.stateoig.gov/foiafees\">www.stateoig.gov/foiafees</a> for OIG requested records.\n    (iii) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by \nthe Department at a Federal records center operated by the National \nArchives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department will charge \nadditional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate \nSchedule established by NARA.\n    (2) Review. The Department will charge review fees to requesters \nwho make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in \nconnection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review \nconducted to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular \nrecord or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the \nadministrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review \nstage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, \nany costs associated with the Department's re-review of the records in \norder to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review \nfees. Review fees shall be charged at the same rates as those charged \nfor a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.\n    (3) Duplication. The Department will charge duplication fees to all \nrequesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this \nsection. The Department must honor a requester's preference for \nreceiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily \nreproducible by the Department in the form or format requested. The \nDepartment charges the direct costs of producing the copy, including \noperator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply \nwith a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic \nformat, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with \nscanning those materials. Duplication fees are as stated at the \nfollowing website: <a href=\"http://foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx\">foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx</a> (section VII, \n``Fees'').\n    (d) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) The Department will not \ncharge search fees for requests by educational institutions, non-\ncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news \nmedia, unless the records are sought for a commercial use.\n    (2) If the Department fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits \nin which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in \nthe instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) \nof this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described \nin paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.\n    (i) If the Department has determined that unusual circumstances as \ndefined by the FOIA apply and the agency provided timely written notice \nto the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with \nthe time limit is excused for an additional 10 days.\n    (ii) If the Department has determined that unusual circumstances as \ndefined by the FOIA apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to \nrespond to the request, the Department may charge search fees, or, in \nthe case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, \nmay charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The \nDepartment must have provided timely written notice of unusual \ncircumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, and the \nDepartment must have discussed with the requester via written mail, \nemail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to \ndo so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the \nrequest in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception \nis satisfied, the Department may charge all applicable fees incurred in \nthe processing of the request.\n    (iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances \nexist as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits \nshall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n    (3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the \nDepartment must provide without charge:\n    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for \nother media); and\n    (ii) The first two hours of search.\n    (4) When, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost \nequivalent) and the first two hours of search, the total fee calculated \nunder paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less, no fee will be \ncharged.\n    (5) Apart from the stated provisions regarding waiver or reduction \nof fees, see paragraph (j) of this section, the Department may in its \nsole discretion decide to not assess fees or to reduce them if it is in \nthe best interests of the government not to do so.\n    (e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When the \nDepartment determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in \naccordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Department must \nnotify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, \nincluding a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, \nunless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as \nthose anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated \nreadily, the Department will advise the requester accordingly. If the \nrequest is not for commercial use, the notice will specify that the \nrequester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of \nduplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, \ntwo hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester \nwhether those entitlements have been provided.\n    (2) In cases in which the Department has notified the requester \nthat the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request \nwill not be considered received and further work will not be completed \nuntil the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated \ntotal fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing \nto pay; or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet \nbeen provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates \nthat the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the \nstatutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or \ndesignation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact \ndollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Department is not \nrequired to accept payments in installments.\n    (3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some \ndesignated amount of fees, but the Department estimates that the total \nfee will exceed that amount, the Department will toll the processing of \nthe request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in \nexcess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. \nThe Department will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise\n\n[[Page 13113]]\n\nthe amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the \nrequest. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume \nfrom where it was at the date of the notification.\n    (4) The Department must make available its FOIA Public Liaison or \nother FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a \nrequest to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n    (f) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide \nspecial services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of \nadministrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service \nshall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that \nrecords are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same \ndocument, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n    (g) Charging interest. The Department may charge interest on any \nunpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date the bill was \nsent to the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate \nprovided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall accrue from the date of the \nbilling until payment is received by the Department. The fact that a \nfee has been received by the Department within the thirty-day grace \nperiod, even if not processed, shall stay the accrual of interest. The \nDepartment must follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of \n1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its \nadministrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting \nagencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n    (h) Aggregating requests. When the Department reasonably believes \nthat a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is \nattempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the \npurpose of avoiding fees, the Department may aggregate those requests \nand charge accordingly. The Department may presume that multiple \nrequests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in \norder to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, \ncomponents will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis \nfor determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the \ncircumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters \ncannot be aggregated.\n    (i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described \nin paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, the Department cannot \nrequire a requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced \nor continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed \n(i.e., payment before copies are sent to the requester) is not advance \npayment.\n    (2) When the Department estimates or determines that a total fee to \nbe charged under this section will exceed $250, it may require that the \nrequester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire \nanticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Department \nmay elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it \nreceives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with \na history of prompt payment.\n    (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly \ncharged FOIA fee to any component within 30 calendar days of the date \nof its billing, the Department may require the requester to pay the \nfull amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, \nand to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated \nfee before the Department begins to process a new request or continues \nto process a pending request or any appeal from that requester. Where \nthe Department has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has \nmisrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying \noutstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of \nidentity. Additionally, if a requester has failed to pay a fee properly \ncharged by another U.S. Government agency in a FOIA case, the \nDepartment may require proof that such fee has been paid before \nprocessing a new or pending request from that requester.\n    (4) In cases in which the Department requires advance payment, the \nrequest will not be considered received and further work will not be \ncompleted until the required payment is received. If the requester does \nnot pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of \nthe Department's fee determination, the request will be closed.\n    (j) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Requesters \nmay seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application \ndemonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the \npublic interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to \npublic understanding of the operations or activities of the government \nand is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n    (2) The Department must furnish records responsive to a request \nwithout charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all \navailable information, that the factors described in paragraphs \n(j)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:\n    (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the \noperations or activities of the government. The subject of the request \nmust concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal \nGovernment with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or \nattenuated.\n    (ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to \ncontribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or \nactivities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are \nmet:\n    (A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully \ninformative about government operations or activities. The disclosure \nof information that already is in the public domain, in either the same \nor a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully \ninformative if nothing new would be added to the public's \nunderstanding.\n    (B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a \nreasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as \nopposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's \nexpertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and \nintention to effectively convey information to the public shall be \nconsidered. The Department will presume that a representative of the \nnews media satisfies this consideration.\n    (iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial \ninterest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the \ninformation is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, \nthe Department will consider the following factors:\n    (A) The Department must identify whether the requester has any \ncommercial interest that would be furthered by the requested \ndisclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or \nprofit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide \nexplanatory information regarding this consideration.\n    (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Department \nmust determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the \nrequest. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the \nrequirement of paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are \nsatisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest \nfurthered by the request. The Department ordinarily will presume that \nwhen a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of \nparagraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not \nprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n[[Page 13114]]\n\nDisclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market \ngovernment information for direct economic return will not be presumed \nto primarily serve the public interest.\n    (3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the \nrequirements for a waiver or reduction of fees, a waiver or reduction \nmust be granted for those records.\n    (4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when \nthe request is first submitted to the Department and should address the \ncriteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request \nat a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or \non administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay \nfees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is \ndenied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the \nfee waiver request was received.\n\n\nSec.  171.17  Preservation of records\n\n    The Department must preserve all correspondence pertaining to the \nrequests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all \nrequested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized \npursuant to title 44 of the United States Code and applicable records \ndisposition schedules, including the General Records Schedule 4.2 of \nthe National Archives and Records Administration. The Department must \nnot dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a \npending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.\n\nSubpart C--Privacy Act Provisions\n\n\nSec.  171.20  Purpose and scope.\n\n    This subpart contains the rules that the Department follows when \nimplementing certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (PA), as \namended, 5 U.S.C. 552a. These rules should be read together with the \nstatute. The rules in this subpart apply to all records in systems of \nrecords maintained by the Department that are retrieved by an \nindividual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures \nby which individuals may request access to records about themselves, \nrequest amendment or correction of those records, and request an \naccounting of disclosures of those records by the Department. If any \nrecords retrieved pursuant to an access request under the PA are found \nto be exempt from access under that Act, they will be processed for \npossible disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 \nU.S.C. 552, as amended. No fees shall be charged when an individual \nrequests access to or amendment of his or her own PA records.\n\n\nSec.  171.21  Definitions.\n\n    As used in this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:\n    (a) Individual means a citizen or a legal permanent resident alien \n(LPR) of the United States.\n    (b) Maintain includes maintain, collect, use, or disseminate.\n    (c) Record means any item, collection, or grouping of information \nabout an individual that is maintained by the Department and that \ncontains the individual's name or the identifying number, symbol, or \nother identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a \nfingerprint, voice print, or photograph.\n    (d) System of records means a group of any records under the \ncontrol of the Department from which information is retrieved by the \nname of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other \nidentifying particular assigned to an individual.\n\n\nSec.  171.22  Request for access to records.\n\n    (a) In general. Requests for access to records under the PA must be \nmade in writing and sent to the Office of Information Programs and \nServices, the Office of Passport Services within the Bureau of Consular \nAffairs, or the Office of Inspector General at the addresses given in \nSec.  171.4. The Director of the Office of Information Programs and \nServices (A/GIS/IPS) is responsible for acting on all PA requests for \nDepartment records except for requests received directly by the Office \nof Inspector General, which processes its own requests for information, \nand the Office of Passport Services within the Bureau of Consular \nAffairs, which receives directly and processes its own PA requests for \ninformation as described in PA System of Record Notice STATE-26. All \nprocessing of PA requests coming under the jurisdiction of the \nDirectorates for Visa Services and Overseas Citizens Services in the \nBureau of Consular Affairs, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the \nBureau of Human Resources, the Office of Medical Services, and the \nForeign Service Grievance Board (FSGB) are handled by those bureaus or \noffices.\n    (b) Description of records sought. Requests for access should \ndescribe the requested record(s) in sufficient detail to permit \nidentification of the record(s). At a minimum, requests should include \nthe individual's full name (including maiden name, if appropriate) and \nany other names used, current complete mailing address, and date and \nplace of birth (city, state and country). Helpful information includes \nthe approximate time period of the record and the circumstances that \ngive the individual reason to believe that the Department maintains a \nrecord under the individual's name or personal identifier, and, if \nknown, the system of records in which the record is maintained. In \ncertain instances, it may be necessary for the Department to request \nadditional information from the requester, either to ensure a full \nsearch, or to ensure that a record retrieved does in fact pertain to \nthe individual.\n    (c) Verification of personal identity. The Department will require \nreasonable identification of individuals requesting records about \nthemselves under the PA's access provisions to ensure that records are \nonly accessed by the proper persons. Requesters must state their full \nname, current address, citizenship or legal permanent resident alien \nstatus, and date and place of birth (city, state, and country). The \nrequest must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either \nnotarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. \nIf the requester seeks records under another name the requester has \nused, a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the requester has \nalso used the other name must be included. Requesters seeking access to \ncopies of the Passport Services' passport records must meet the \nrequirements in paragraph (d) of this section.\n    (d) Special requirements for passport records. Given the sensitive \nnature of passport records and their use, requesters seeking access to \ncopies of passport records from Passport Services under the PA must \nsubmit a letter that is either notarized or made under penalty of \nperjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, which includes the full name at \nbirth and any subsequent name changes of the individual whose records \nare being requested (if submitting the request on behalf of a minor, \nprovide the representative's full name as well); the date and place of \nbirth of the individual whose records are being requested; the \nrequester's current mailing address; and, if available, daytime \ntelephone number and email address; the date or estimated date the \npassport(s) was issued; the passport number of the person whose records \nare being sought, if known; and any other information that will help to \nlocate the records. The requester must also include a clear copy of \nboth sides of the requester's valid government-issued photo \nidentification, e.g., a driver's license.\n    (e) Authorized third party access. The Department shall process all \nproperly authorized third party requests, as\n\n[[Page 13115]]\n\ndescribed in this section, under the PA. In the absence of proper \nauthorization from the individual to whom the records pertain, the \nDepartment will process third party requests under the FOIA. The \nDepartment's form, DS-4240, may be used to certify identity and provide \nthird party authorization. Forms created by other Federal agencies will \nnot be accepted.\n    (1) Parents and guardians of minor children. Upon presentation of \nacceptable documentation of the parental or guardian relationship, a \nparent or guardian of a U.S. citizen or LPR minor (an unmarried person \nunder the age of 18) may, on behalf of the minor, request records under \nthe PA pertaining to the minor. In any case, U.S. citizen or LPR minors \nmay request such records on their own behalf.\n    (i) Verification of parentage or guardianship of minor children. \nWhen making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor child, for \naccess to records about that individual, a requester must establish:\n    (A) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the \nrecords, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth;\n    (B) The requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of \nthis section;\n    (C) That the requester is the parent of that individual, which the \nrequester may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth \ncertificate showing parentage, or by providing a court order \nestablishing guardianship; and\n    (D) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in \nmaking the request.\n    (2) Guardians of incompetent adults. A guardian of an individual \nwho has been declared by a court to be incompetent may act for and on \nbehalf of the incompetent individual upon presentation of appropriate \ndocumentation of the guardian relationship.\n    (i) Verification of guardianship of incompetent adult. When making \na request as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be \nincompetent, for access to records about that individual, a requester \nmust establish:\n    (A) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the \nrecords, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth;\n    (B) The requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of \nthis section;\n    (C) That the requester is the guardian of that individual, which \nthe requester may prove by providing a copy of a court order \nestablishing guardianship; and\n    (D) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in \nmaking the request.\n    (2) Authorized representatives or designees. When an individual \nwishes to authorize the Department to permit a third party access to \nhis or her records, the individual to whom the records pertain must \nsubmit, in addition to the identity verification information described \nin paragraph (c) (or paragraph (d) of this section if the request is \nfor passport records), a signed statement from the individual to whom \nthe records pertain, either notarized or made under penalty of perjury \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, giving the Department authorization to \nrelease records about the individual to the third party. The designated \nthird party must submit identity verification information described in \nparagraph (c) of this section. Third party requesters seeking access to \ncopies of the Passport Office's records must submit a clear copy of \nboth sides of a valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a \ndriver's license) in addition to the other information described above.\n    (f) Referrals and consultations. If the Department determines that \nrecords retrieved as responsive to the request were created by another \nagency, it ordinarily will refer the records to the originating agency \nfor direct response to the requester. If the Department determines that \nDepartment records retrieved as responsive to the request are of \ninterest to another agency, it may consult with the other agency before \nresponding to the request. The Department may make agreements with \nother agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for \nparticular types of records.\n    (g) Records relating to civil actions. Nothing in this subpart \nentitles an individual to access to any information compiled in \nreasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.\n    (h) Time limits. The Department will acknowledge the request \npromptly and furnish the requested information as soon as possible \nthereafter.\n\n\nSec.  171.23  Request to amend or correct records.\n\n    (a) An individual has the right to request that the Department \namend a record pertaining to the individual that the individual \nbelieves is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.\n    (b) Requests to amend records must be in writing and mailed or \ndelivered to A/GIS/IPS or OIG at the address given in Sec.  171.4, with \nATTENTION: PRIVACY ACT AMENDMENT REQUEST written on the envelope. A/\nGIS/IPS or OIG will coordinate the review of the request with the \nappropriate offices under its purview. The Department will require \nverification of personal identity as provided in Sec.  171.22(c) before \nit will initiate action to amend a record. Amendment requests should \ncontain, at a minimum, identifying information needed to locate the \nrecord in question, a description of the specific correction requested, \nand an explanation of why the existing record is not accurate, \nrelevant, timely, or complete. The request must be signed, and the \nrequester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of \nperjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. The requester should submit as much \npertinent documentation, other information, and explanation as possible \nto support the request for amendment.\n    (c) All requests for amendments to records shall be acknowledged \nwithin 10 working days.\n    (d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the \nDepartment shall review the record to determine if it is accurate, \nrelevant, timely, and complete.\n    (e) If the Department agrees with an individual's request to amend \na record, it shall:\n    (1) Advise the individual in writing of its decision;\n    (2) Amend the record accordingly; and\n    (3) If an accounting of disclosure has been made, advise all \nprevious recipients of the record of the amendment and its substance.\n    (f) If the Department denies an individual's request to amend a \nrecord, it shall advise the individual in writing of its decision and \nthe reason for the refusal, and the procedures for the individual to \nrequest further review. See Sec.  171.25.\n\n\nSec.  171.24  Request for an accounting of record disclosures.\n\n    (a) How made. Except where accountings of disclosures are not \nrequired to be kept, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, or \nwhere accountings of disclosures do not need to be provided to a \nrequesting individual pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), an individual \nhas a right to request an accounting of any disclosure that the \nDepartment has made to another person, organization, or agency of any \nrecord about such individual, provided that the disclosed records are \nmaintained in a system of records. This accounting shall contain the \ndate, nature, and purpose of each disclosure as well as the name and \naddress of the recipient of the disclosure. Any request for accounting \nshould identify each\n\n[[Page 13116]]\n\nparticular record in question and may be made by writing directly to A/\nGIS/IPS at the address given in Sec.  171.4.\n    (b) Where accountings not required. The Department is not required \nto keep an accounting of disclosures in the case of:\n    (1) Disclosures made to employees within the Department who have a \nneed for the record in the performance of their duties; and\n    (2) Disclosures required under the FOIA.\n\n\nSec.  171.25  Appeals from denials of PA amendment requests.\n\n    (a) If the Department denies a request for amendment of such \nrecords, the requester shall be informed of the reason for the denial \nand of the right to appeal the denial within 90 working days of the \ndate of the Department's denial letter.\n    (b) For decisions made by A/GIS/IPS, requesters should submit their \nappeal to the A/GIS/IPS FOIA Appeals Office. The contact information \nfor A/GIS/IPS is contained in the FOIA Reference Guide, which is \navailable at <a href=\"http://www.state.gov\">www.state.gov</a>. Appeals can be submitted by mail or email \nto <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d6b62646c7f687c78687e794d7e796c7968236a627b\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"086e6761697a6d797d6d7b7c487b7c697c6d266f677e\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. To facilitate handling, the requester should \nmark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the \nelectronic transmission, ``Privacy Act Appeal.''\n    (c) For decisions made by OIG, requesters should submit their \nappeal to the OIG. The contact information for OIG is available at \n<a href=\"http://www.stateoig.gov/foiaappeals\">www.stateoig.gov/foiaappeals</a>. To facilitate handling, the requester \nshould mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the \nelectronic transmission, ``Privacy Act Appeal.''\n    (d) Appellants should submit an administrative appeal of any \ndenial, in whole or in part, of a request for access to FSGB records \nunder the PA to A/GIS/IPS at the above address. A/GIS/IPS will assign a \ntracking number to the appeal and forward it to the FSGB, which is an \nindependent body, for adjudication.\n    (e) A/GIS/IPS or OIG will decide appeals from denials of PA \namendment requests within 30 working days from the date when the appeal \nis received, unless an extension of that period for good cause shown is \nneeded.\n    (f) Decisions will be made in writing, and appellants will receive \nnotification of the decision. A reversal will result in reprocessing of \nthe request in accordance with that decision. An affirmance will \ninclude a brief statement of the reason for the affirmance and will \ninform the appellant that the decision represents the final decision of \nthe Department and of the right to seek judicial review of the \ndecision, when applicable.\n    (g) If the decision is that a record shall be amended in accordance \nwith the appellant's request, A/GIS/IPS or OIG shall direct the office \nunder its purview that is responsible for the record to amend the \nrecord, advise all previous recipients of the record of the amendment \nand its substance (if an accounting of previous disclosures has been \nmade), and so advise the individual in writing.\n    (h) If the decision is that the amendment request is denied, in \naddition to the notification required by paragraph (f) of this section, \nA/GIS/IPS or OIG shall advise the appellant:\n    (1) Of the right to file a concise Statement of Disagreement \nstating the reasons for disagreement with the decision of the \nDepartment;\n    (2) Of the procedures for filing the Statement of Disagreement;\n    (3) That any Statement of Disagreement that is filed will be made \navailable to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, \ntogether with, at the discretion of the Department, a brief statement \nby the Department summarizing its reasons for refusing to amend the \nrecord;\n    (4) That prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a \ncopy of any statement of disagreement, to the extent that an accounting \nof disclosures was maintained.\n    (i) If the appellant files a Statement of Disagreement under \nparagraph (h) of this section, the Department will clearly annotate the \nrecord so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent to \nanyone who may subsequently access the record. When the disputed record \nis subsequently disclosed, the Department will note the dispute and \nprovide a copy of the Statement of Disagreement. The Department may \nalso include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the \nrecord. Copies of the Department's statement shall be treated as part \nof the individual's record for granting access; however, it will not be \nsubject to amendment by an individual under this part.\n\n\nSec.  171.26  Exemptions.\n\n    Systems of records maintained by the Department are authorized to \nbe exempt from certain provisions of the PA under both general and \nspecific exemptions set forth in the Act. In utilizing these \nexemptions, the Department is exempting only those portions of systems \nthat are necessary for the proper functioning of the Department and \nthat are consistent with the PA. Where compliance would not interfere \nwith or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it \nmay be appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the \ninformation collected, the applicable exemption may be waived, either \npartially or totally, by the Department or the OIG, in the sole \ndiscretion of the Department or the OIG, as appropriate. Records exempt \nunder 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) by the originator of the record remain \nexempt if subsequently incorporated into any Department system of \nrecords, provided the reason for the exemption remains valid and \nnecessary.\n    (a) General exemptions. If exempt records are the subject of an \naccess request, the Department will advise the requester of their \nexistence and of the name and address of the source agency, unless that \ninformation is itself exempt from disclosure.\n    (1) Individuals may not have access to records maintained by the \nDepartment that are maintained or originated by the Central \nIntelligence Agency under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(1).\n    (2) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), individuals may not \nhave access to records maintained or originated by an agency or \ncomponent thereof that performs as its principal function any activity \npertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, including police \nefforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime or to apprehend criminals, \nand the activities of prosecutors, courts, correctional, probation, \npardon, or parole authorities, and which consists of:\n    (i) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual \ncriminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of \nidentifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition \nof criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and \nprobation status;\n    (ii) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal \ninvestigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and \nassociated with an identifiable individual; or\n    (iii) Reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage \nof the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or \nindictment through release from supervision. The reason for invoking \nthese exemptions is to ensure effective criminal law enforcement \nprocesses.

    "abstract": "The Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs (\"Department\"), is amending its regulation governing the issuance of visas in the \"B\" nonimmigrant classification for temporary visitors for pleasure. This rule establishes that travel to the United States with the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for a child by giving birth in the United States is an impermissible basis for the issuance of a B nonimmigrant visa. Consequently, a consular officer shall deny a B nonimmigrant visa to an alien who he or she has reason to believe intends to travel for this primary purpose. The Department does not believe that visiting the United States for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for a child, by giving birth in the United States--an activity commonly referred to as \"birth tourism\"--is a legitimate activity for pleasure or of a recreational nature, for purposes of consular officers adjudicating applications for B nonimmigrant visas. The final rule addresses concerns about the attendant risks of this activity to national security and law enforcement, including criminal activity associated with the birth tourism industry, as reflected in federal prosecutions of individuals and entities involved in that industry. The final rule also codifies a requirement that B nonimmigrant visa applicants who seek medical treatment in the United States must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the consular officer, their arrangements for such treatment and establish their ability to pay all costs associated with such treatment. The rule establishes a rebuttable presumption that a B nonimmigrant visa applicant who a consular officer has reason to believe will give birth during her stay in the United States is traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for the child.",

    "supplementary_information": "I. What changes to 22 CFR 41.31 does this rule make?\n\n    This rule makes certain changes to the Department's regulation on B \nnonimmigrant visas, but does not change Department of Homeland Security \nregulations regarding the admissibility of aliens, including Visa \nWaiver Program travelers, or otherwise modify the standards enforced by \nofficials of the Department of Homeland Security. The Department is \nrevising the definition of ``pleasure'' and subdividing 22 CFR \n41.31(b)(2) into three paragraph levels. The Department is retaining \nits existing, and longstanding, general rule that pleasure, as referred \nto in Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 101(a)(15)(B), 8 \nU.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(B), for purposes of visa issuance, refers to \nlegitimate activities of a recreational character, including tourism, \namusement, visits with friends or relatives, rest, medical treatment, \nand activities of a fraternal, social, or services nature. The \nDepartment is also adding a provision that provides, for purposes of \nvisa issuance, that the term pleasure, as used in INA 101(a)(15)(B), 8 \nU.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(B), does not include travel for the primary purpose \nof obtaining United States citizenship for a child by giving birth in \nthe United States. The Department is renumbering this provision as \nparagraph (i).\n    The Department is adding a provision that provides that a \nnonimmigrant B visa applicant seeking medical treatment in the United \nStates shall be denied a visa under INA section 214(b), 8 U.S.C. 1184, \nif unable to establish, to the satisfaction of a consular officer, a \nlegitimate reason why he or she wishes to travel to the United States \nfor medical treatment, and that a medical practitioner or facility in \nthe United States has agreed to provide treatment. Additionally, the \napplicant must provide the projected duration and cost of treatment and \nany incidental expenses. The applicant must also establish to the \nsatisfaction of the consular officer that he or she has the means and \nintent to pay for the medical treatment and all incidental expenses, \nincluding transportation and living expenses, either independently or \nwith the pre-arranged assistance of others. If an applicant's responses \nto this line of questions are not credible, that may give consular \nofficers reason to question whether the applicant qualifies for a visa \nin the B nonimmigrant classification, and could lead to additional \nquestions as to whether the applicant intends to timely depart the \nUnited States, or intends to engage in other impermissible activity. \nThe Department is renumbering this provision as paragraph (ii).\n    The Department is adding a new paragraph (iii), which establishes a \nrebuttable presumption that any B nonimmigrant visa applicant who a \nconsular officer has reason to believe will give birth during her stay \nin the United States is traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining \nU.S. citizenship for a child.\n\nII. Why is the Department promulgating this rule?\n\n    Section 101(a)(15)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(B), is \nambiguous as to the scope of activities covered by the phrase \n``visiting the United States . . . temporarily for pleasure.'' Birth \ntourism is not explicitly mentioned in INA 101(a)(15)(B), 8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)(15)(B). The Department is aware that many foreign nationals \nhave sought B nonimmigrant visas for the purpose of obtaining U.S. \ncitizenship for a child by giving birth in the United States. The \nDepartment has concluded that a more reasonable interpretation of the \nstatutory provision and a better policy is that the statutory provision \nauthorizing the issuance of visas to temporary visitors for pleasure \ndoes not extend to individuals whose primary purpose of travel is to \nobtain U.S. citizenship for a child by giving birth in the United \nStates. The Department considers birth tourism an inappropriate basis \nfor the issuance of temporary visitor visas for the policy reasons \ndiscussed herein.\n    As discussed below, this rule reflects a better policy, as birth \ntourism poses risks to national security. The birth tourism industry is \nalso rife with criminal activity, including international criminal \nschemes, as reflected in federal prosecutions of individuals and \nentities involved in that industry.\n    The Department recognizes that some aliens may wish to rely on U.S. \nmedical facilities for birth because of specialized medical needs that \ncan be met in the United States. Thus, given the Department's \nlongstanding practice of considering receipt of medical treatment as \nlegitimate activity for purposes of B nonimmigrant visa issuance, this \nrule seeks to balance the United States' strong interest in curtailing \nbirth tourism with its interests in facilitating legitimate medical \ntravel and other legitimate travel on a B nonimmigrant visa. In order \nto clarify when visa issuance for the purpose of travel to the United \nStates for medical treatment while pregnant (and likely to give birth) \nmight be acceptable, the Department is codifying in regulation the \nstandards regarding B nonimmigrant visa issuance for travel for medical \ntreatment. Nothing in this rule purports to affect the acquisition of \nU.S. citizenship by individuals born in the United States, under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the\n\n[[Page 4221]]\n\nU.S. Constitution or INA 301, 8 U.S.C. 1401.\n\nA. Primary Purpose\n\n    This rule, which explicitly establishes that birth tourism is not a \npermissible purpose for issuance of a B visa, also reflects--for the \nfirst time in regulation--a longstanding Department doctrine of visa \nadjudication--namely, the primary purpose test. Under the primary \npurpose test, a consular officer must consider a visa applicant's \nprimary (or principal) purpose of travel to evaluate the applicant's \neligibility for the requested visa classification. All of a visa \napplicant's intended activities in the United States are considered in \ndetermining the applicant's eligibility for a visa under standards set \nout in INA 212 and 214(b), 8 U.S.C. 1182 and 1184, and other applicable \nvisa eligibility standards. The Department's FAM guidance to consular \nofficers on this point--that an ``alien desiring to come to the United \nStates for one principal, and one or more incidental, purposes should \nbe classified in accordance with the principal purpose''--has remained \nunchanged for well over 30 years. Compare 9 FAM 41.11 N3.1 (August 30, \n1987) with current 9 FAM 402.1-3 (last revised May 21, 2018).\\1\\ For B \nnonimmigrant visa applicants, the primary purpose of travel must be for \npermissible B-1 or B-2 activity for business or pleasure. Under the \nprimary purpose test, in the context of a B-1/B-2 visa application, a \nconsular officer may not issue a visa to an applicant who: (1) \nPrimarily intends to engage in activity properly classified in another \nnonimmigrant visa classification; or (2) primarily intends to engage in \nany other activity not permissible in the B nonimmigrant visa \nclassification. In addition, no visa may be issued to an alien who \nintends to engage in any unlawful activity. An alien's ``primary \npurpose'' of travel would be determined by the consular officer based \non what the consular officer concludes is the alien's principal \nobjective for traveling to the United States, following careful \nconsideration of information submitted by the applicant and the \nconsular officer's evaluation of the credibility of the applicant.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ The Board of Immigration Appeals has also long evaluated an \nalien's primary purpose in various contexts. See, e.g., Matter of \nHoeft, 12 I&N Dec. 182 (BIA 1967) (alien whose primary purpose of \nentry was to engage in full-time employment and did not have a labor \ncertification ineligible for Adjustment of Status); Matter of M-, 3 \nI&N Dec. 218 (BIA 1948) (alien not subject to Excludability under \nsection 3 of the Immigration Act of 1917, entry for immoral purpose, \nwhere her primary purpose of travel was to visit fianc[eacute]e); \nMatter of Healy and Goodchild, 17 I. & N. Dec. 22, 26 (BIA 1979) \n(holding that an alien bound for the United States for the primary \npurpose of study is not admissible as a nonimmigrant visitor for \npleasure).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For example, consider a minor applying for a B nonimmigrant visa to \naccompany his legal guardian, but not parent, in the United States on \nanother nonimmigrant visa classification (e.g., H-1B). The minor would \nnot qualify for a derivative visa (e.g., H-4), because he is not a \nchild of the guardian. In that case, the minor's primary purpose of \ntravel would be to accompany his guardian, which is permissible \nactivity in the B visa classification. The Department's FAM guidance \nhas long acknowledged a tension that arises with minors who are legally \nrequired under state or local law in the United States to attend school \nwhile residing, even if temporarily, in the United States, but whose \nprimary purpose of travel is to accompany an adult to whose household \nthey belong. The Department's FAM guidance has long provided that \n``when a family member's primary purpose to come to the United States \nis to accompany the principal, the classification of the accompanying \n[minor] family member is either of a derivative of the principal, if \nthe classification provides, or as a B-2, if not.''\n    The burden is on the visa applicant to establish that he or she is \nentitled to nonimmigrant status under INA 101(a)(15) of the INA, 8 \nU.S.C. 1101(a)(15), based on his or her primary purpose of travel, to \nthe satisfaction of the consular officer. See INA section 214(b), 291, \n8 U.S.C. 1184(b), 1361.\n\nB. National Security and Law Enforcement Concerns With Birth Tourism\n\n    The Department estimates that thousands of children are born in the \nUnited States to B-1/B-2 nonimmigrants annually. While the Department \nrecognizes that precisely estimating the number of individuals who give \nbirth in the United States, after traveling to the United States on a \nB1/B2 nonimmigrant visa, is challenging, reporting from U.S. embassies \nand consulates has documented trends showing an increasing number of B \nvisa applicants whose stated primary purpose of travel is to give birth \nin the United States. Permitting short-term visitors with no \ndemonstrable ties to the United States to obtain visas to travel to the \nUnited States primarily to obtain U.S. citizenship for a child creates \na potential long-term vulnerability for national security. Foreign \ngovernments or entities, including entities of concern to the United \nStates, may seek to benefit from birth tourism for purposes that would \nthreaten the security of the United States. This rule would help close \na potential vulnerability to national security that would be posed by \nany foreign government or entity that sought to exploit birth tourism \nto enhance access to the United States.\n    The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that \n``[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject \nto the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of \nthe state wherein they reside.'' Section 301(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \n1401(a) states that ``a person born in the United States, and subject \nto the jurisdiction thereof'' shall be a national and citizen of the \nUnited States at birth. The INA provides a clear method for those who \ndo not acquire U.S. citizenship at birth to acquire it later: \nNaturalization.\n    This is a stark difference between aliens using a temporary visitor \nvisa for the purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for their children \nand the extensive requirements applicants must meet to naturalize to \nbecome U.S citizens. To naturalize, an alien must establish attachment \nto the principles of the Constitution of the United States and \nfavorable disposition toward the ``good order and happiness'' of the \nUnited States, including a depth of conviction that would lead to \nactive support of the Constitution, and not be hostile to the basic \nform of government of the United States, or disbelieve in the \nprinciples of the Constitution. See 8 U.S.C. 1427(a); 8 CFR 316.11(a). \nAdult citizens are entitled to numerous rights and benefits of \ncitizenship, including the right to vote in federal elections, the \nability to run for public office, the ability to serve on a jury, and \nthe option to petition immediate family members to immigrate to the \nUnited States when they reach the age of twenty-one. Citizens have a \nright to enter the United States even without a U.S. passport. See \nWorthy v. United States, 328 F. 2d 386, 394 (5th Cir. 1964). The \nprevious regulation failed to address the national security \nvulnerability that could allow foreign governments or entities to \nrecruit or groom U.S. citizens who were born as the result of birth \ntourism and raised overseas, without attachment to the United States, \nin manners that threaten the security of the United States.\n    An entire ``birth tourism'' industry has evolved to assist pregnant \nwomen from other countries to come to the United States to obtain U.S. \ncitizenship for their children by giving birth in the United States, \nand thereby entitle their children to the benefits of U.S.\n\n[[Page 4222]]\n\ncitizenship.\\2\\ Birth tourism companies advertise their businesses \nabroad by promoting the citizenship-related benefits of giving birth in \nthe United States. Companies tout a broad range of benefits for the \nU.S. citizen child and eventually its family, including, but not \nlimited to, access to free education, less pollution, retirement \nbenefits, the ability to compete for jobs in the U.S. government, and \nthe ability for the whole family to eventually immigrate to the United \nStates.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ United States v. Li, 19-cr-00016 (S.D. Cal., filed Jan 30, \n2019), United States v. Liang, 15-cr-00061 (C.D. Cal., filed May 18, \n2015).\n    \\3\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By obtaining a child's U.S. citizenship through birth tourism, \nforeign nationals are able to help that child avoid the scrutiny, \nstandards, and procedures that he or she would normally undergo if he \nor she sought to become a U.S. citizen through naturalization. Under \nINA section 316, 8 U.S.C 1427, for example, such aliens generally are \nrequired to fulfill a residency requirement of at least five years, be \na person of good moral character attached to the principles of the \nConstitution, and be well disposed to the ``good order and happiness'' \nof the United States. Additionally, they are required to take an Oath \nof Allegiance. See section 337(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1448(a). The \nsteps for naturalization are rigorous and include national security-\nrelated inquiries, requiring applicants to meet stringent residency \nrules, complete multiple forms collecting detailed personal \ninformation, provide fingerprints, complete an in-person interview, and \npass English and civics tests.\n    Foreign travelers have sought to gain the numerous benefits of U.S. \ncitizenship for their children by obtaining visas to travel to the \nUnited States to give birth, while in some cases, passing along the \ncosts to tax payers at the state and local level. Some of these \nbenefits include ease of travel to countries that offer visa-free \ntravel to U.S. citizens, the ability to study and work in the United \nStates, and a legal path for the child's parents to immigrate to the \nUnited States once the child turns twenty-one. U.S. embassies and \nconsulates have reported that visa applicants intending to give birth \nin the United States provide numerous reasons for their choice, \nincluding, but not limited to, obtaining a second citizenship for their \nchild, the perceived low-cost medical services available to women in \nthe United States, the lower cost of obtaining U.S. citizenship through \nbirth tourism than through a U.S. investor visa, and the perceived \nguarantee of a better socioeconomic future for their child.\n    While this rule will not preclude visa issuance to all aliens who \nmay give birth in the United States, it recognizes the risks posed by \nallowing the previous visa policy to continue; and addresses some of \nthose national security threats that exist when aliens, who may have no \nties to, or constructive interest in, the United States, easily are \nable to obtain U.S. citizenship for their children, through birth in \nthe United States.\n    The birth tourism industry in the United States also is a source of \nfraud and other criminal activity, including international criminal \nschemes. A recent federal indictment of 19 individuals on immigration \nfraud charges shows that businesses in the lucrative birth tourism \nindustry committed ``widespread immigration fraud and engaged in \ninternational money laundering,'' as well as defrauding ``property \nowners when leasing the apartments and houses used in their birth \ntourism schemes.'' \\4\\ According to the recent federal indictment, in \nexchange for their services, birth tourism operators charged as much as \n$100,000 and one of the largest operators is alleged to have used ``14 \ndifferent bank accounts to receive more than $3.4 million in \ninternational wire transfers'' in a two year period alone.\\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-unseal-indictments-naming-19-people-linked-chinese-birth-tourism\">https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-unseal-indictments-naming-19-people-linked-chinese-birth-tourism</a>.\n    \\5\\ <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-unseal-indictments-naming-19-people-linked-chinese-birth-tourism\">https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-unseal-indictments-naming-19-people-linked-chinese-birth-tourism</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    This rule explicitly establishes that birth tourism is not a \npermissible purpose of travel for issuance of a B visa. This rule will \nhelp eliminate the criminal activity associated with the birth tourism \nindustry. The recent federal indictments describe birth tourism schemes \nin which foreign nationals applied for visitor visas to come to the \nUnited States and lied to consular officers about the duration of their \ntrips, where they would stay, and their purpose of travel. According to \nthe indictments that charge the operators of the birth tourism schemes, \nforeign women were coached on how to pass their U.S. visa interviews by \nlying on their visa application forms and providing false statements to \nconsular officers. The applicants also provided false statements on \ntheir visa applications and in their interviews about the funds \navailable to them to cover the costs of their proposed treatment and \nstay in the United States.\\6\\ When foreign travelers lie about their \ntrue purpose of travel to the United States during their visa \ninterviews, consular officers may not identify a true basis for visa \nineligibility, including, for example, lack of intent or ability to pay \nfor the costs of their stay. This rule, by limiting the circumstances \nin which an alien will be in a position to give birth in the United \nStates on a ``tourist'' visa, will potentially decrease the number of \nbirth tourism providers in the United States, thus discouraging aliens \nfrom applying for visas to travel to the United States for this \npurpose. By explicitly establishing that birth tourism is not a \npermissible purpose for issuance of a B visa, this rule will reduce the \nnumber of visa applicants who apply for B visas for the purpose of \nbirth tourism.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ United States v. Li, 19-cr-00016 (S.D. Cal., filed Jan 30, \n2019).

The \ninvestigation into birth tourism operators in California uncovered a \nscheme where birth tourism operators enriched themselves ``using cash, \nfabricated financial documents, and nominee names for the transfer of \nmoney'' \\7\\ from overseas to the United States. In some cases, birth \ntourism operators leased apartments by providing false information \nabout the true occupants of the residences, making false statements \nabout occupants' monthly income, and furnishing altered bank statements \nin order to be approved for leases.\\8\\ The federal indictments \nhighlight accounts of birth tourism customers failing to pay all the \ncosts of giving birth in the United States, including hospital, doctor, \nand other bills, which would then be referred to collection.\\9\\ In one \nexample, a couple ``paid only $4,600 of the $32,291 in hospital charges \nrelated to the birth of their baby.'' \\10\\ In another example, a couple \npaid a hospital the indigent rate of $4,080 for hospital bills that \nexceeded $28,000, despite having more than $225,000 in a U.S. bank \naccount and making purchases at Rolex and Louis Vuitton stores during \ntheir\n\n[[Page 4223]]\n\ntime in the United States.\\11\\ Meanwhile, birth tourism operators are \nearning millions of dollars through the scheme, evading taxes, money \nlaundering, and engaging in fraud to enhance their profits.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-unseal-indictments-naming-19-people-linked-chinese-birth-tourism\">https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-unseal-indictments-naming-19-people-linked-chinese-birth-tourism</a>.\n    \\8\\ United States v.

Medical Treatment\n\n    Under previous Department guidance and under this rule, medical \ntreatment, whether medically necessary or elective, generally continues \nto be permissible activity in the B nonimmigrant classification, \nsubject to certain restrictions.\n    Under guidance to consular officers in the Department's Foreign \nAffairs Manual (FAM) \\12\\ and this rule, an applicant who seeks a B \nnonimmigrant visa for medical treatment in the United States shall be \ndenied a visa under INA section 214(b), 8 U.S.C. 1184(b), if unable to \nestablish, to the satisfaction of a consular officer, a legitimate \nreason why he or she wishes to travel to the United States for medical \ntreatment. Additionally, the applicant must satisfy the consular \nofficer that a medical practitioner or facility in the United States \nhas agreed to provide treatment. The applicant must also establish to \nthe satisfaction of the consular officer that he or she has reasonably \nestimated the duration of the visit and has the means, derived from \nlawful sources, and intent to pay for the medical treatment and all \nincidental expenses. If an applicant's responses to this line of \ninquiry are not credible, that may give consular officers reason to \nquestion whether the applicant intends to timely depart the United \nStates or intends to engage in other impermissible activity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See 9 FAM 402.2-4(A)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The two new sentences in Sec.  41.31(b)(2)(ii) added by this rule \ntrack language about medical treatment and the B-2 nonimmigrant \nclassification on the Department's public facing website. See <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html</a>. \n\\13\\ The identified information often helps inform a consular officer's \ndetermination whether the applicant qualifies for a B visa, including \nwhether the applicant overcomes the presumption in INA 214(b), 8 U.S.C. \n1184(b), that he or she is an intending immigrant, and whether the \napplicant is ``entitled to a nonimmigrant status under section \n101(a)(15).'' INA 214(b), 8 U.S.C. 1184(b).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Department is adding this provision to Sec.  41.31(b) now \nbecause application of these factors will have a direct bearing on \nimplementation of this new policy that a primary purpose of obtaining \nUnited States citizenship for a child by giving birth in the United \nStates (as opposed to travel for the primary purpose of obtaining \nmedical treatment for reasons related to childbirth for maternal or \ninfant health) is an impermissible basis for B visa issuance. For a B \nnonimmigrant visa applicant who seeks to travel to the United States to \ngive birth, consular officers will evaluate whether the applicant has \ncredibly articulated a permissible purpose of travel on a B visa, or \nwhether the applicant's primary purpose of travel is birth tourism, \ni.e., to obtain U.S. citizenship for the child.\n    The Department believes including the new provisions in Sec.  41.31 \nclarify the requirements for all B nonimmigrant applicants who seek \nmedical treatment in the United States, by including the factors that a \nconsular officer will weigh when determining whether the applicant \nqualifies for a B nonimmigrant visa. These regulatory refinements \nshould be particularly helpful for applicants who are likely to give \nbirth in the United States, to help them determine whether they are \neligible to apply for a B nonimmigrant visa.\n\nD. Presumption of Intent\n\n    Under this rule, if a consular officer has reason to believe a B \nnonimmigrant visa applicant will give birth in the United States, the \napplicant is presumed to be seeking a visa for the primary purpose of \nobtaining U.S. citizenship for the child. To rebut this presumption, \nthe visa applicant must establish, to the satisfaction of a consular \nofficer, a legitimate primary purpose other than obtaining U.S. \ncitizenship for a child by giving birth in the United States. The fact \nthat an applicant has arranged an elective medical birth plan (as \nopposed to a birth requiring specialized medical treatment) in the \nUnited States is not, by itself, sufficient to establish that the \nprimary purpose is not obtaining U.S. citizenship for the child. Take, \nfor example, a visa applicant who identified several potential options \nin multiple countries that would satisfy her medical birth plan. If \nthat visa applicant arranged a birth plan in the United States, instead \nof in another country, because the child would acquire U.S. \ncitizenship, the presumption would likely not be rebutted, especially \nif she had ties to a geographically closer country that would meet her \nneeds. But, for another example, consider an otherwise qualified B \nnonimmigrant visa applicant from a part of Mexico lacking appropriate \nmedical facilities who arranged a birth plan in the United States based \non proximity to her residence in Mexico. In that case, the presumption \ncould be rebutted. A visa applicant who identified a birth plan in the \nUnited States based on specialized medical care for a complicated \npregnancy could also potentially rebut the presumption. Medical care is \nnot the only way the presumption can be rebutted. For example, if a \nconsular officer determined an individual's primary purpose for travel \nto the United States is to visit her dying mother, and that during the \nvisit she may give birth in the United States because her due date \noverlapped with her mother's last expected months of life, she could \nrebut the presumption. For another example, if a B nonimmigrant visa \napplicant satisfied the consular officer that her child would acquire \nU.S. citizenship if born outside the United States under section 301(g) \nof the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1401(g), based on the visa applicant's husband's \nU.S. citizenship and prior physical presence in the United States, the \nvisa applicant would rebut the presumption that her primary purpose was \nto obtain U.S. citizenship for the child.\n\nIII. Regulatory Findings\n\nA. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n    This rule is exempt from notice and comment under the foreign \naffairs exemption of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \n553(a).\n    Opening this pronouncement of foreign policy to public comment, \nincluding comment from foreign government entities themselves, and \nrequiring the Department to respond publicly to pointed questions \nregarding foreign policy decisions would have definitely undesirable \ninternational consequences. See Yassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, n.4 \n(9th Cir. 1980). The Department recognizes specifically that foreign \ngovernments or parts thereof may have interests in this rule as a \nmatter of their foreign policy goals. The Department has concerns that \nbirth tourism, and the birth tourism industry, pose a significant \nvulnerability for the security of the United States. Various public \nsources have identified specific countries that are the primary sources \nof birth tourists, some of which countries have very sensitive \nrelationships with the United States. Some governments may support \ntheir citizens' desire to use U.S. temporary visitor visas as a \nmechanism to obtain U.S. citizenship for their children. Foreign \ngovernments or entities, including entities of concern to the United \nStates, may seek to benefit\n\n[[Page 4224]]\n\ndirectly or indirectly from birth tourism, including for purposes that \nwould threaten the security of the United States. As a DOJ \nrepresentative stated during hearings on the Administrative Procedure \nAct, ``[a] requirement of public participation in . . . promulgation of \nrules to govern our relationships with other nations . . . would \nencourage public demonstrations by extremist factions which might \nembarrass foreign officials and seriously prejudice our conduct of \nforeign affairs.'' Administrative Procedure Act: Hearings on S.1663 \nBefore the Subcomm. on Admin. Practice & Procedure of the S. Comm. on \nthe Judiciary, 88th Cong. at 363 (1964).\n    Recognizing that certain countries have been publicly identified as \nbeing principal sources of foreign nationals pursuing birth tourism, \nand certain of those countries raise particular national security \nconcerns, this rule clearly and directly impacts foreign affairs \nfunctions of the United States and ``implicat[es] matters of diplomacy \ndirectly.'' City of N.Y. v. Permanent Mission of India to the U.N., 618 \nF.3d 172, 202 (2d Cir. 2010). This regulatory change reflects changes \nto U.S. foreign policy, specifically in the context of U.S. visas, that \nsignificantly narrow the ability of foreign nationals residing abroad \nto easily obtain U.S. citizenship for their children without complying \nwith any of the rigorous requirements for permanent residence or \nnaturalization. Publicly identifying birth tourism as a threat to the \nsecurity of the United States, in a context where specific countries \nhave been identified as the primary source of birth tourists, \ninherently affects U.S. bilateral relations with those countries, and \nsignals a significant shift in U.S. policy towards those foreign \ngovernments and their populations. This modification of U.S. visa \npolicy may also lead to reciprocal actions on the part of foreign \ngovernments, including some countries in which there are a significant \nnumber of U.S. citizens residing.\n\nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272 (Small Business)\n\n    Because this final rule is exempt from notice and comment \nrulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the regulatory \nflexibility analysis requirements set forth by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604).\n\nC. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) is intended, among \nother things, to curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal \nmandates on State, local, and tribal governments. Title II of UMRA \nrequires each Federal agency to prepare a written statement assessing \nthe effects of any Federal mandate in a proposed or final agency rule \nthat may directly result in a $100 million or more expenditure \n(adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year by State, local, and \ntribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector. This \nrule governs B nonimmigrant visa classification and does not mandate \nany direct expenditure by State, local, or tribal governments.\n\nD. Congressional Review Act\n\n    The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined \nthat this rule is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2), for \npurposes of congressional review of agency rulemaking under the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.\n\nE. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 \n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)\n\n    The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has \ndetermined that this rule is significant under Executive Order 12866, \nthough not economically significant. Thus, it has been reviewed by \nOIRA. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public \nhealth and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). The \nDepartment has reviewed this rule to ensure consistency with those \nrequirements.\n    The Department has also considered this rule in light of Executive \nOrder 13563 and affirms that this regulation is consistent with the \nguidance therein.\n    In crafting this rule, the Department considered alternate ways to \naddress the national security concerns associated with birth tourism. \nThe Department seeks to balance the United States' strong interest in \ncurtailing birth tourism, based on national security and law \nenforcement concerns, with its commitment to facilitating legitimate \nmedical travel and other legitimate bases for issuing B nonimmigrant \nvisas.\n    The Department recognizes this rule may result in indirect costs to \nstate and local entities and the private sector associated with loss of \nbusiness from foreign national customers who seek to travel to the \nUnited States for the primary purpose of obtaining United States \ncitizenship for a child by giving birth in the United States.\n    As detailed above, the rule aims to end a threat to national \nsecurity and to mitigate criminal activity associated with the birth \ntourism industry. Birth tourism companies highlight the benefits of \neligibility and priority for jobs in U.S. government, public companies \nand large corporations.\n    This rule represents the most narrowly tailored regulation to \nmitigate the threat. The Department considered whether all B-1/B-2 visa \napplicants, and applicants for visas in other nonimmigrant \nclassifications, might be denied, in accordance with the INA, in any \ncase where a consular officer reasonably expects the applicant will \ngive birth in the United States to a child who would become a U.S. \ncitizen solely because of the place of birth. The Department decided \nnot to adopt such an interpretation, instead limiting this policy to B-\n1/B-2 nonimmigrant visa applicants and limiting it to applicants who \nhave a primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for a child \nexpected to be born in the United States. Notably, the B visa \nclassification constitutes the vast majority of nonimmigrant visa \napplications and the one that is typically used for birth tourism.\n    With the understanding that some foreign nationals have \nhistorically applied for and obtained B nonimmigrant visas for the \nprimary purpose of giving birth in the United States to obtain U.S. \ncitizenship for the child, the Department crafted this rule narrowly to \naddress core national security-related concerns.\n\nF. Executive Orders 12372 and 13132 (Federalism)\n\n    The objective of E.O. 13132 is to guarantee the Constitution's \ndivision of governmental responsibilities between the federal \ngovernment and the states. It furthers the policies of the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act. This rule does not have federalism implications \nwithin the meaning of E.O. 13132, because it does not impose any \nsubstantial direct compliance costs on State, local, or tribal \ngovernments or preempt State, local, or tribal law. Furthermore, this \nrule does not involve grants, other forms of financial assistance, and \ndirect development that implicate concerns under E.O. 12372.\n\nG. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform)\n\n    The Department has reviewed the regulation in light of sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize\n\n[[Page 4225]]\n\nlitigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce burden.\n\nH. Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments)\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have a \nsubstantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, will not impose \nsubstantial direct compliance costs on Indian tribal governments, on \nthe relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nI. Executive Order 13771 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling \nRegulatory Costs)\n\n    This rule is not subject to the requirements of E.O. 13771 (82 FR \n9339, February 3, 2017), because it is expected to be de minimis under \nE.O. 13771.\n\nJ. Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new information collection \nrequirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 \nU.S.C. Chapter 35. The Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application, DS-160, \nalready allows visa applicants to identify medical treatment as a \nsubset of B visa travel purpose. Consular officers would evaluate the \napplication using existing forms and would not need new approved \ninformation collections.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 41\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Foreign Relations, Visas, \nAliens, Foreign official, Employment, Students, Cultural Exchange \nPrograms.\n\nText of the Rule\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department \nis amending 22 CFR part 41 as follows:\n\nPART 41--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION \nAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.

    "abstract": "This final rule amends Department of State (\"Department\") regulations by prescribing how consular officers will determine whether an alien is ineligible for a visa under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), because he or she is likely at any time to become a public charge. Aliens who seek a visa, application for admission, or adjustment of status must establish that they are not likely at any time to become a public charge, unless Congress has expressly exempted them from this ground of ineligibility or if the alien obtained a waiver. This interim final rule adds certain definitions, including definitions of public charge, public benefit, alien's household, and receipt of public benefit. This interim final rule reflects the Department's interpretation of the pertinent section of the INA as it applies to visa applicants. This rulemaking is also intended to align the Department's standards with those of the Department of Homeland Security, to avoid situations where a consular officer will evaluate an alien's circumstances and conclude that the alien is not likely at any time to become a public charge, only for the Department of Homeland Security to evaluate the same alien when he seeks admission to the United States on the visa issued by the Department of State and finds the alien inadmissible on public charge grounds under the same facts. The Department is also removing the reference to fee collection for review and assistance with submitting an affidavit of support at consular posts as consular posts do not collect this fee, and an obsolete process related to bonds.",

    "supplementary_information": "I. What changes are in Sec.  40.41?\n\n    This interim final rule codifies changes to 22 CFR 40.41, which is \nthe Department of State's (``Department'') interpretation and \nimplementation of the public charge ground of visa ineligibility, \nsection 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA'' or \n``Act''), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). This interim final rule supersedes all \nprior inconsistent guidance on the public charge visa ineligibility. \nAccordingly, this supersedes all Department guidance that previously \nlimited the interpretation of ``likely at any time to become a public \ncharge'' as likely to become primarily dependent on the government \n(federal, state, or local) for subsistence (previously limited to \npublic cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization \nfor long-term care at government expense).\n    The INA renders inadmissible (and therefore ineligible for a visa, \nineligible for admission to the United States, and ineligible for \nadjustment of status) any alien who, in the opinion of a consular \nofficer (or the Departments of Homeland Security (``DHS'') or Justice \n(``DOJ''), as applicable) is likely at any time to become a public \ncharge. The statute does not define the term ``public charge.'' The \nstatutory public charge provision provides that administering agencies \nmust ``at a minimum consider the alien's age; health; family status; \nassets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills.'' \nThe agencies may also consider any affidavit of support, under section \n213A of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, (i.e., Form I-864, Affidavit of \nSupport Under Section 213A of the INA) submitted on the alien's behalf. \nINA 212(a)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B). In general, the public charge \nineligibility applies to both nonimmigrants and immigrants, although \nsome classes of nonimmigrants and immigrants are exempt from the \nineligibility ground. The DHS regulation at 8 CFR 212.23(a) lists the \ncategories of exempt aliens. This interim final rule neither alters the \nclassifications of aliens who are exempt from this ineligibility ground \nnor bears on the classifications of visas available to aliens.\n    The interim final rule makes several changes to paragraph (a) Basis \nfor Determination of Ineligibility. First, the interim final rule adds \nlanguage from the statute, ``at any time,'' to the existing regulatory \nlanguage. Next, the interim final rule adds a reference to INA \n212(a)(4)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(D), the requirement that an \nemployment-based immigrant whose relative filed the immigrant visa \npetition or has a significant ownership interest in the entity that \nfiled the immigrant visa petition, is ineligible unless such relative \nhas executed a sufficient affidavit of support for such alien. The \ninterim final rule adds language indicating that the consular officer \nwill ``consider whether any third party'' listed in the affidavit of \nsupport will be ``willing and able to financially support the alien \nwhile the alien is in the United States.'' The Department is not \nchanging the temporal reference for the consular officer's \ndetermination, which currently and under the interim final rule, is any \ntime ``after admission.''\n    Next, in paragraph (a), the interim final rule incorporates ``more \nlikely than not,'' the preponderance of the evidence standard, as the \nDepartment's interpretation of ``likely'' relating to the standard that \nconsular officers will use when evaluating whether an alien is likely \nto become a public charge.\n    Additionally in paragraph (a), the interim final rule cites to the \nstatutory requirement from section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4), that consular officers will at the time of visa application \ntake into account statutory factors, including the alien's age; health; \nfamily status; assets, resources, financial status; and education and \nskills. More specifically, the interim final rule codifies Department \nof State Foreign Affairs Manual (``FAM'') guidance that consular \nofficers must consider, at a minimum, those factors as part of the \ntotality of the applicant's circumstances. This interim final rule then \nexplains the Department's interpretation of each factor.\n    Age: Consular officers will consider whether the alien's age makes \nthe alien more likely than not to become a public charge in the \ntotality of the circumstances, such as by impacting the alien's ability \nto work. Consular officers will consider an alien's age between 18 and \n62 as a positive factor. Age will be considered a negative factor for \naliens who are under the age of 18 or over 62. However, consular \nofficers may consider other factors, such as the support provided to a \nminor child by a parent, legal guardian, or other source, that in the \ntotality of the circumstances may offset the alien's age as a negative \nfactor. This generally restates current FAM guidance that being under \n18 years old is a negative factor in the totality of the circumstances \nif the visa applicant\n\n[[Page 54997]]\n\nis neither accompanied by a parent or guardian or following to join a \nparent or guardian. The interim final rule also codifies into \nregulation existing FAM guidance that an applicant's age is a negative \nfactor in the totality of the circumstances, if the consular officer \nbelieves it adversely affects the person's ability to obtain or perform \nwork or may increase the potential for healthcare related costs that \nwould be borne by the public.\n    Health: Under the interim final rule, consular officers will \nconsider whether the alien's health serves as a positive or negative \nfactor in the totality of the circumstances, including whether the \nalien has been diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to \nrequire extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that \nwill interfere with the alien's ability to provide and care for himself \nor herself, to attend school, or to work (if authorized). This new \nprovision clarifies current FAM guidance. The new provision adds that \nconsular officers will consider the report of a medical examination \nperformed by the panel physician where such examination is required, \nincluding any medical conditions noted by the panel physician. A Class \nB medical condition, including Class B forms of communicable diseases \nof public health significance, as defined in 42 CFR part 34, will not, \nstanding alone, result in a finding of ineligibility for public charge. \nIn assessing the effect of the alien's health on a public charge \ndetermination, the interim final rule provides that the consular \nofficer will consider evidence of health insurance or the ability to \npay for reasonably foreseeable medical expenses in the United States a \npositive factor in the totality of the circumstances. Under this \nstandard, lack of health insurance alone would not make an alien more \nlikely than not to become a public charge at any time, but would \ninstead be considered in the totality of the alien's circumstances. \nThis standard generally reflects existing guidance that certain health \nissues could increase the burden on the applicant to provide \ninformation demonstrating the ability to pay for medical expenses in \nthe United States, potentially including proof of health insurance.\n    Family status: The interim final rule reflects that when \nconsidering an alien's family status, consular officers will consider \nthe size of the alien's household, and whether the alien's household \nsize makes the alien likely to become a public charge at any time in \nthe future. The term ``alien's household'' is defined in paragraph (d). \nHousehold size is a positive factor if the family size makes the alien \nunlikely to receive public benefits at any time in the future.\n    Assets, resources, and financial status: The interim final rule \nspecifies several nonexclusive aspects of the alien's assets, \nresources, and financial status consular officers will consider. First, \nwith regard to an alien's household gross income, the interim final \nrule specifies that annual gross income for the applicant's household \nsize of at least 125 percent of the most recent Federal Poverty \nGuidelines based on the applicant's household size (or 100 percent for \nan applicant on active duty, other than training, in the Armed Forces), \nis a positive factor. Second, if the applicant's annual household gross \nincome is less than 125 percent of the most recent Federal Poverty \nGuidelines (or 100 percent for an applicant on active duty, other than \ntraining, in the Armed Forces) based on the applicant's household size, \nthe applicant can submit evidence of ownership of assets, which may \naffect the consular officer's determination. If the total value of the \nhousehold assets, offsetting for liabilities, is at least five times \nthe difference between the applicant's household gross income and 125 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (or 100 percent for an \napplicant on active duty, other than training, in the Armed Forces) for \nthe applicant's household size, then that will be considered a positive \nfactor. However, if the alien is the spouse or child of a U.S. citizen, \nassets totaling three times the difference between the alien's \nhousehold gross income and 125 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines (100 percent for those on active duty, other than training, \nin the Armed Forces) for the alien's household size is a positive \nfactor. If the alien is a child who will be adopted in the United \nStates and who will likely receive citizenship under INA 320, 8 U.S.C. \n1432, then assets equivalent to or greater than the difference between \nthe alien's household gross income and 125 percent of the Federal \nPoverty Guidelines (100 percent for those on active duty, other than \ntraining, in the Armed Forces) for the alien's household size is a \npositive factor. This reflects a change from existing FAM guidance, \nwhich recognizes income above 125 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuideline and assets in the amount of five times 125 percent of the \nFederal Poverty Guideline generally as sufficient resources for \novercoming public charge concerns.\n    The interim final rule provides that, when considering an alien's \nassets, resources, and financial status, consular officers may not \nconsider any income from illegal activities or sources, such as \nproceeds from illegal gambling or drug sales, or income from public \nbenefits, as defined in the interim final rule. This policy is being \nexplicitly articulated for the first time. The interim final rule then \nlists several specific nonexclusive factors consular officers will \nconsider in evaluating whether the alien's assets, resources, and \nfinancial status make an alien likely to become a public charge. These \ninclude the alien's household gross income; the alien's cash assets and \nresources; non-cash assets and resources that can be converted into \ncash within twelve months of the date of the visa application; the \nalien's financial liabilities; whether the alien has applied for, been \ncertified to receive or approved to receive, or received, one or more \npublic benefits, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section on or \nafter October 15, 2019, or whether the alien has disenrolled or \nrequested to be disenrolled from such benefits; whether the alien has \nreceived an immigration benefit fee waiver from DHS on or after the \ninterim final rule's effective date; and whether the applicant has \nprivate health insurance or other financial resources sufficient to pay \nfor reasonably foreseeable medical costs. This interpretation \nintroduces two factors: past DHS fee waivers and private health \ninsurance or other means to cover reasonably foreseeable medical costs, \nboth of which have direct bearing on the visa applicant's assets, \nresources, and financial status.\n    The interim final rule also changes how consular officers will \nconsider past receipt of public benefits. Current FAM guidance directs \nconsular officers to consider receipt of public assistance of any type \nby the visa applicant or a family member in the visa applicant's \nhousehold when determining the likelihood a visa applicant would become \na public charge. The interim final rule explicitly addresses the \napplicant's receipt of public benefits, and incorporates the \nDepartment's new definition of public benefit. Consular officers will \nonly consider listed public benefits received on or after October 15, \n2019, except that consular officers will consider as a negative factor, \nbut not a heavily weighted negative factor, receipt of cash assistance \nfor income maintenance or programs supporting institutionalization for \nlong term care in the United States, received, or certified for receipt \nbefore October 15, 2019. Additionally, the current FAM guidance does \nnot specifically limit a consular officer's consideration to U.S. forms \nof public assistance, but the interim final\n\n[[Page 54998]]\n\nrule only covers United States (federal, state, local, or tribal) \npublic assistance.\n    Education and skills: When considering an alien's education and \nskills, consular officers will consider both positive and negative \nfactors associated with whether the alien has adequate education and \nskills to either obtain or maintain lawful employment with an income \nsufficient to avoid being likely to become a public charge. In \nassessing whether the alien's level of education and skills makes the \nalien likely to become a public charge, the consular officer must \nconsider, among other factors, the alien's history of employment, \neducational level (high school diploma, or its equivalent, or a higher \neducational degree), any occupational skills, certifications, or \nlicenses, and proficiency in English or proficiency in other languages \nin addition to English. This standard provides additional detail and in \nsome respects changes the guidance currently given to consular officers \nin the FAM. Currently, FAM guidance directs consular officers to \nconsider the applicant's skills, length of employment, and frequency of \njob changes, and permitted consular offices to consider that work \nexperience is evidence of skills. The Department is superseding the \nFAM's treatment of work experience as evidence of skills, by requiring \nonly that consular officers consider the alien's history of employment. \nThe Department is also introducing the new concept of whether an alien \nis a primary caregiver, considering as a positive factor under the \ntotality of the circumstances if the alien is over 18 years of age and \nhas ``significant responsibility for actively caring for and managing \nthe well-being of a minor, elderly, ill, or disabled person residing in \nthe alien's household, such that the alien lacks an employment history \nor current employment, or is not employed full time.''\n    Prospective Visa Classification: The interim final rule adds \nconsideration of the alien's prospective visa classification.\n    Affidavit of Support: The interim final rule states that a \nsufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, where it \nis required, is a positive factor in the totality of the circumstances \nif the sponsor is likely to actually provide the alien with the \nstatutorily required amount of financial support and other related \nconsiderations that may indicate the ability or willingness of the \nsponsor to provide support. Department guidance has reflected this \ninterpretation since January 2018. Also, in paragraph (a)(7), the \nDepartment removed reference to fee collection for review and \nassistance with submitting an affidavit of support at consular posts, \nas consular posts do not collect an affidavit of support fee overseas.\n    Heavily Weighted Factors: The interim final rule then introduces \ncertain factors and factual circumstances that will weigh heavily in \ndetermining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge, \nincluding negative and positive factors. The heavily weighted negative \nfactors are:\n    <bullet> The alien is not a full-time student and is authorized to \nwork, but is unable to satisfy the consular officer that he or she is \ncurrently employed, has recent employment history, or a reasonable \nprospect of future employment;\n    <bullet> The alien has received, or has been certified or approved \nto receive, one or more public benefits, as defined in 22 CFR 40.41(c), \nfor more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period \n(such that for instance receipt of two benefits in one month, counts as \ntwo months' worth of benefits), beginning no earlier than 12 a.m., \nOctober 15, 2019, or 36 months prior to the adjudication of the alien's \nvisa application, whichever is later;\n    <bullet> The alien has been diagnosed with a medical condition that \nis likely to require extensive treatment or institutionalization or \nthat will interfere with the alien's ability to provide for himself or \nherself, attend school, or work;\n    <bullet> The alien has no health insurance for use in the United \nStates and has neither the prospect of obtaining private health \ninsurance, nor the financial resources to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs related to such medical condition;\n    <bullet> The alien was previously found inadmissible or deportable \non public charge grounds by an Immigration Judge or the Board of \nImmigration Appeals.\n    The heavily weighted positive factors are:\n    <bullet> The alien's household has income, assets, resources, or \nsupport of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for \nthe alien's household size. Consular officers may not consider any \nincome from illegal activities, e.g., proceeds from illegal gambling or \ndrug sales, or any income derived from any public benefit as defined in \n22 CFR 40.41(c);\n    <bullet> The alien is authorized to work and is currently employed \nwith an annual income of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines for the alien's household size. Consular officers may not \nconsider any income from illegal activities, e.g., proceeds from \nillegal gambling or drug sales; and\n    <bullet> The alien has private health insurance (other than health \ninsurance obtained with premium tax credits under the Affordable Care \nAct) for use in the United States covering the expected period of \nadmission.\n    Treatment of forms of public assistance received before October 15, \n2019. Under this interim final rule, consular officers will consider as \na negative factor, but not as a heavily weighted negative factor as \ndescribed in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, forms of assistance \nreceived prior to October 15, 2019 only if such assistance would have \nbeen considered in the public charge determination between May 25, 1999 \nand January 2, 2018. These are limited to (1) any amount of cash \nassistance for income maintenance, including Supplemental Security \nIncome (``SSI''), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (``TANF''), \nState and local cash assistance programs that provide benefits for \nincome maintenance (often called ``General Assistance'' programs), and \n(2) programs (including Medicaid) supporting aliens who are \ninstitutionalized for long-term care, received before October 15, 2019. \nShort-term institutionalization for rehabilitation (including under \nMedicaid), received before October 15, 2019, will not be considered in \nthe public charge determination under the interim final rule. Under \nthis interim final rule, the Department will no longer authorize \nconsular officers to consider other forms of public assistance, \ndomestic or foreign, in the totality of the circumstances public charge \ncalculation.\n    Public Charge Definition: In paragraph (b), the interim final rule \nintroduces a new definition of public charge. Under previous Department \nguidance in effect since May 1999, consular officers considered an \napplicant likely to become a public charge if the applicant is likely, \nat any time after admission, to become primarily dependent on the U.S. \nGovernment (which includes Federal, state, or local governments) for \nsubsistence. Public charge, for purposes of INA 212(a)(4)(A) and (B), 8 \nU.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(A) and (B), is defined under the interim final rule \nas an alien who receives one or more public benefits for more than 12 \nmonths in the aggregate within any 36-month period (such that, for \ninstance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months' \nworth of benefits).\n    Public Benefit Definition: In paragraph (c), the interim final rule \nintroduces a new definition of public benefit. Prior guidance limited \nthe types of benefits to receipt of public cash assistance for income \nmaintenance and\n\n[[Page 54999]]\n\ninstitutionalization for long-term care at U.S. Government expense. The \nDepartment adopted this interpretation in the FAM based on the former \nImmigration and Naturalization Service (``INS'') interpretation of the \npublic charge inadmissibility, as explained in the INS Notice, Field \nGuidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, \n64 FR 28689 (May 26, 1999).\n    Under the Department's new definition, ``public benefit'' means:\n    <bullet> Any Federal, State, local, or tribal cash assistance for \nincome maintenance (other than tax credits), including:\n    [cir] Supplemental Security Income (SSI), 42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.;\n    [cir] Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), 42 U.S.C. 601 \net seq.;\n    [cir] Federal, State or local cash benefit programs for income \nmaintenance (often called ``General Assistance'' in the State context, \nbut which also exist under other names);\n    <bullet> Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), 7 U.S.C. \n2011 et seq.;\n    <bullet> Medicaid under 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., except for:\n    [cir] Benefits received for an emergency medical condition as \ndescribed in section 1903(v)(2)-(3) of Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct, 42 U.S.C. 1396b(v)(2)-(3), 42 CFR 440.255(c);\n    [cir] services or benefits funded by Medicaid but provided under \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. 1400 \net seq.;\n    [cir] school-based services or benefits provided to individuals who \nare at or below the oldest age eligible for secondary education as \ndetermined under State or local law; or\n    [cir] benefits received by an alien under 21 years of age, or a \nwoman during pregnancy (and during the 60-day period beginning on the \nlast day of the pregnancy).\n    <bullet> Public housing and rental assistance programs under \nsections 8-9 of the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437f-g.\n    Exclusions from the Public Benefit Definition: Public benefit, \nunder the interim final rule, does not include any public benefit \nreceived by an alien who at the time of receipt of the public benefit, \nor at the time of visa application or visa adjudication, is or was:\n    <bullet> Enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces under the authority of \n10 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B) or 10 U.S.C. 504(b)(2) (or is the spouse or \nchild of such person),\n    <bullet> serving in active duty or in the Ready Reserve component \nof the U.S. Armed Forces (or is the spouse or child of such person), or\n    <bullet> the spouse or child of an individual enlisted in the U.S. \nArmed Forces under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B) or 10 U.S.C. \n504(b)(2), or in the Ready Reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\n    For the purpose of visa adjudication for which the public charge \nground of ineligibility applies, public benefit, as defined in this \nsection, does not include any public benefit received by an alien \nduring periods in which the alien was present in the United States in \nan immigration category that is exempt from the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility, as set forth in 8 CFR 212.23(a), or for which the \nalien received a waiver of public charge inadmissibility from DHS. \nPublic benefit does not include health services for immunizations and \nfor testing and treatment of communicable diseases, including \ncommunicable diseases of public health significance as defined in 42 \nCFR part 34. Public benefits are limited to benefits received from \ngovernmental and tribal entities in the United States and does not \ninclude benefits from foreign governments. Public benefit also does not \ninclude any public benefit received by:\n    <bullet> Children of U.S. citizens whose lawful admission for \npermanent residence and subsequent residence in the legal and physical \ncustody of their U.S. citizen parent will result automatically in the \nchild's acquisition of citizenship under the Child Citizenship Act of \n2000, Public Law 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631 (INA section 320(a)-(b), 8 \nU.S.C. 1431(a)-(b) in accordance with 8 CFR part 320);\n    <bullet> children of U.S. citizens whose lawful admission for \npermanent residence will result automatically in the child's \nacquisition of citizenship upon finalization of adoption, if the child \nsatisfies the requirements applicable to adopted children under INA \n101(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1) in the United States by the U.S. citizen \nparent(s) and meets other eligibility criteria as required by the Child \nCitizenship Act of 2000, Public Law 106-395, 114 Stat. 16341 (INA \nsection 320(a)-(b), 8 U.S.C. 1431(a)-(b), in accordance with 8 CFR part \n320); or\n    <bullet> children of U.S. citizens who are entering the United \nStates for the purpose of attending an interview under section 322 of \nthe INA, 8 U.S.C. 1433, in accordance with 8 CFR part 322.\n    Additionally, the interim final rule makes clear that only certain \nforms of public assistance received on or after 12:00 a.m., October 15, \n2019 fall within the definition of ``public benefit'' for the purpose \nof applying the public charge ground of ineligibility, with the \nexception of cash assistance for income maintenance and programs \nsupporting institutionalization for long term care in the United \nStates, as detailed in Sec.  40.41(a)(9).\n    Alien's Household: The interim final rule sets out new standards to \ndetermine the members of an ``alien's household'' at paragraph (d). One \nstandard applies to aliens who are twenty-one years of age or older and \nalso applies to married individuals under twenty-one, whereas a \nseparate standard applies to children, who are defined by the INA as \nunmarried persons under twenty-one years of age. If the alien is \ntwenty-one years of age or older, or married and of any age, the \nalien's household includes:\n    <bullet> The alien;\n    <bullet> The alien's spouse, if physically residing or intending to \nphysically reside with the alien in the United States;\n    <bullet> The alien's children, as defined in 101(b)(1) of the INA, \n8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), if physically residing or intending to physically \nreside with the alien;\n    <bullet> The alien's other children, as defined in section \n101(b)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), not physically residing or \nnot intending to physically reside with the alien for whom the alien \nprovides or is required to provide at least 50 percent of the \nchildren's financial support, as evidenced by a child support order or \nagreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other order or \nagreement specifying the amount of financial support to be provided by \nthe alien;\n    <bullet> Any other individuals (including a spouse not physically \nresiding or not intending to physically reside with the alien) to whom \nthe alien provides, or is required to provide, at least 50 percent of \nthe individual's financial support or who are listed as dependents on \nthe alien's United States federal income tax return; and\n    <bullet> Any individual who provides to the alien at least 50 \npercent of the alien's financial support, or who lists the alien as a \ndependent on his or her federal income tax return.\n    If the alien is a child as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the INA, \n8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), the alien's household includes the following \nindividuals:\n    <bullet> The alien;\n    <bullet> The alien's children as defined in section 101(b)(1) of \nthe INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), physically residing or intending to \nphysically reside with the alien;\n    <bullet> The alien's other children as defined in section 101(b)(1) \nof the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), not physically residing or not \nintending to physically reside with the alien, for whom the alien \nprovides or is required to provide\n\n[[Page 55000]]\n\nat least 50 percent of the children's financial support, as evidenced \nby a child support order or agreement, a custody order or agreement, or \nany other order or agreement specifying the amount of financial support \nto be provided by the alien;\n    <bullet> The alien's parents, legal guardians, or any other \nindividual providing or required to provide at least 50 percent of the \nalien's financial support to the alien as evidenced by a child support \norder or agreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other order or \nagreement specifying the amount of financial support to be provided to \nthe alien;\n    <bullet> The parents' or legal guardians' other children as defined \nin section 101(b)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), physically \nresiding or intending to physically reside with the alien;\n    <bullet> The alien's parents' or legal guardians' other children as \ndefined in section 101(b)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1), not \nphysically residing or not intending to physically reside with the \nalien for whom the parent or legal guardian provides or is required to \nprovide at least 50 percent of the other children's financial support, \nas evidenced by a child support order or agreement, a custody order or \nagreement, or any other order or agreement specifying the amount of \nfinancial support to be provided by the parents or legal guardians; and\n    <bullet> Any other individual(s) to whom the alien's parents or \nlegal guardians provide, or are required to provide at least 50 percent \nof such individual's financial support or who is listed as a dependent \non the parent's or legal guardian's federal income tax return.\n    This definition varies in certain aspects from existing FAM \nguidance. First, the Department is adopting different standards for \napplicants who are at least 21 years of age (or married and any age), \nand children. Prior guidance did not make such distinctions and placed \nmore focus on the alien's sponsor, if required. However, the text of \nINA 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), focuses on whether the visa \napplicant will become a public charge and requires the Department to \nconsider the applicant's family status.\n    Receipt of Public Benefit: In paragraph (e), the interim final rule \nsets out new standards for what constitutes ``receipt of public \nbenefit.'' Receipt of public benefit occurs when a public benefit \ngranting agency provides a public benefit, as defined in Sec.  \n40.41(c), to the visa applicant as a beneficiary, whether in the form \nof cash, voucher, services, or insurance coverage. Application or \ncertification for a public benefit does not constitute receipt of \npublic benefit, but it may be considered as a factor suggesting \nlikelihood of future receipt. An alien's receipt of, application for, \nor certification for, a public benefit solely on behalf of another \nindividual does not constitute receipt of, application for, or \ncertification for, such alien, regardless of whether the alien might \ngain personally from the third party's benefit. This new standard will \nhelp consular officers implement the new ``public charge'' definition \nat paragraph (b), referring to an alien who receives one or more public \nbenefits, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, for more than 12 \nmonths in the aggregate within any 36-month period. It also clarifies \nthat consular officers must evaluate whether the alien is likely to \nreceive one or more public benefits, the impact of certification for \nfuture receipt of a public benefits, and that the relevant \nconsideration is the alien's future receipt, or expected receipt, of \npublic benefits, not an application or certification solely on behalf \nof another person. Because 40.41(c) limits the definition of ``public \nbenefit'' to specified forms of public assistance received on or after \n12 a.m., October 15, 2019, an alien will not be considered to have \nreceived a public benefit before that date.\n    The paragraph in Sec.  40.41 titled Prearranged Employment, \nformerly (e), is redesignated (f). The interim final rule does not \nchange the text of these sections. Finally, the Department is removing \nPosting of a Bond, formerly (d), and Joint Sponsors, formerly paragraph \n(c) and Use of the Federal Poverty Line Where INA 213A Not Applicable, \nformerly paragraph (f). These paragraphs were removed because language \nwas not necessary; they either restated statutory requirements or were \nobsolete.\n\nII. Why is the Department promulgating this rule?\n\nA. Background\n\n    On August 14, 2019, DHS issued a final rule outlining its new \ninterpretation of the public charge ground of inadmissibility. See \nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 FR 41292. Under DHS's \nprior interpretation of ``public charge'' an alien would be \ninadmissible if he or she would be ``primarily dependent on the \nGovernment for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of \npublic cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization \nfor long-term care at Government expense.'' Since May 1999, Department \nguidance has used the same standard. As a consequence, an alien's \nreliance on or receipt of non-cash benefits such as SNAP, Medicaid, \nhousing vouchers and other housing subsidies, and other programs that \nDHS now considers ``public benefit'' pursuant to its new definition of \n``public charge'' were not previously considered by DHS or the \nDepartment in determining whether an alien is deemed likely at any time \nto become a public charge.\n    DHS revised its interpretation of ``public charge'' to incorporate \nconsideration of such benefits in order to better ensure that aliens \nsubject to the public charge inadmissibility ground are not dependent \non public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own \ncapabilities, as well as the resources of family members, sponsors, and \nprivate organizations. The DHS rule redefines the term ``public \ncharge'' to mean an alien who receives one or more designated public \nbenefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month \nperiod (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month \ncounts as two months' worth of benefits). The DHS final rule defines \nthe term `public benefit' with a finite list of public benefits that \nare considered for purposes of the public charge determination, \nincluding Federal, state, local or tribal cash assistance for income \nmaintenance, Supplemental Security Income (``SSI''), SNAP, most forms \nof Medicaid, Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice \nVoucher (``HCV'') Program, Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, \nand certain other forms of subsidized housing. See Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 84 FR 41292 (Aug. 14, 2019).\n    Because section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), renders \ninadmissible aliens ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be \nadmitted to the United States, the Department is also modifying its \ninterpretation in some respects. The Department's new standards are \nintended to avoid situations where a consular officer will evaluate an \nalien's circumstances and conclude that the alien is not likely at any \ntime to become a public charge, only for DHS to evaluate the same alien \nwhen he seeks admission to the United States on the visa issued by the \nDepartment of State and finds the alien inadmissible on public charge \ngrounds under the same facts. Although the Department has chosen to \nfollow DHS's approach in many respects, this interim final rule \nreflects the Department's independent interpretations and policies. In \naddition, some aspects of the rule may deviate from the DHS approach \ndue to the differing circumstances of visa applicants, who\n\n[[Page 55001]]\n\nreside outside the United States and typically have not spent \nsubstantial time in the United States, as contrasted with applicants \nfor USCIS-administered benefits, which applicants commonly are in the \nUnited States and have spent substantial time there.\n\nB. Specific Provisions\n\n    In addition to the reasons cited in Section (II)(A), the Department \nadopts the interpretations set forth in the interim final rule based on \nthe additional considerations below.\n1. Basis for Determination of Ineligibility\n    The new reference to the Affidavit of Support provision for certain \nemployment-based immigrants reflects the statutory requirement that \naliens who are the beneficiary of petitions filed pursuant to section \n212(a)(4)(D) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(D), by a relative or an \nentity in which a relative has a significant ownership interest are \nineligible without an Affidavit of Support from such relative. \nSignificant ownership interest means 5 percent or more under existing \nDepartment guidance. See also 8 CFR 213a.1. This addition does not \nreflect a policy change. The Department is also clarifying that \nconsular officers will consider whether a third party is willing and \nable to financial support the alien in the United States. A third party \ncould be the sponsor, or, for example, for a B-1/B-2 applicant, the \nalien's parent or child. This clarifies current policy and is not a \npolicy change.\n    Also in paragraph (a), the interim final rule incorporates ``more \nlikely than not'' as the standard that consular officers will use when \nevaluating whether an alien is ``likely'' to become a public charge. \nSection 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), specifies that the \npublic charge ground will apply to ``any alien who, in the opinion of \nthe consular officer . . . is likely at any time to become a public \ncharge''. The Department believes that the word ``likely'' could be \nambiguous to consular officers, particularly given the overall \nsubjective nature of the standard (``in the opinion of the consular \nofficer''), and that both consular officers and visa applicants would \nbenefit from having a more clear standard of proof and adjudicatory \nframework.\n    The requisite degree of proof in civil matters is generally a \npreponderance of the evidence, which is synonymous with ``more likely \nthan not.'' The standard of proof specified by the INA that must be met \nby individuals applying for visas is ``to the satisfaction of the \nconsular officer.'' See INA 291, 8 U.S.C. 1361. However, most \nprovisions in section 212(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), also require \nconsular officers either to have a ``reason to believe'' or to evaluate \nwhether as a factual matter something has happened in the past (e.g., \nthat a visa applicant was convicted of a particular crime or engaged in \ntrafficking activity). The public charge provision, like certain other \nprovisions, requires a consular officer to assess the likelihood of an \nevent happening in the future, which here serves as the sole criterion \nfor whether the ineligibility applies. To clarify the standard for \nconsular officers, the Department is interpreting ``likely'' as ``more \nlikely than not'' in the context of the public charge ineligibility \nground, which will eliminate ambiguity from the phrase ``likely at any \ntime'' by requiring a consular officer to make a finding that it is \nprobable, i.e., more likely than not, that an applicant will at any \ntime in the future become a public charge for this ground of \nineligibility to apply. Conversely, this standard makes clear to \napplicants that they can avoid application of the public charge ground \nof ineligibility by demonstrating that it is not more likely than not \nthat they will become a public charge at any time in the future.\n    The interim final rule also cites in paragraph (a) to the statutory \nrequirement from section 212(a)(4)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4)(B), that consular officers will, at the time of visa \napplication, take into account statutory factors, including the alien's \nage; health; family status; assets, resources, financial status; and \neducation and skills. The rule also explains that consular officers \nmust consider those factors, among others, as part of the totality of \nthe applicant's circumstances. The interim final rule then explains the \nDepartment's interpretation of each factor. The Department's standards \nwill be implemented through guidance that is consistent with standards \nannounced in the DHS final rule, and will mitigate against the \npossibility that consular officers would issue a visa to an individual \nwhom DHS would find inadmissible based on the same facts. However, the \nDepartment's standards are in some ways tailored specifically for \nunique aspects of visa adjudication.\na. Age\n    Consular officers will consider whether the alien's age makes the \nalien more likely than not to become a public charge in the totality of \nthe circumstances, such as by impacting the alien's ability to obtain \nand perform work. Consular officers will consider an alien's age \nbetween 18 and 62 as a positive factor, which takes into consideration \n``early retirement age'' for Social Security set forth in 42 U.S.C. \n416(l)(2). The 18-through-62 age range is based on the ages at which \npeople are generally able to work full-time and prior to an \nindividual's general ability to retire with some social security \nretirement benefits under Federal law.\n    Under this provision, being under 18 would be a negative factor. \nThe Department notes this approach reflects the common understanding of \nwhen people are generally able to work full-time and that children \nunder the age of 18 generally face difficulties working full-time. \nFederal laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, and some state laws \nplace restrictions on the ability of children under the age of 18 to \nwork full-time. Additionally, individuals under the age of 18 may be \nmore likely to qualify for and receive public benefits. For example, \nthe U.S. Census reported that persons under the age of 18 were more \nlikely to receive means-tested benefits than other age groups. See \nJessica L. Semega et al., U.S. Census Bureau, Income and Poverty in the \nUnited States: 2016, at 13 tbl.3 (Sept. 2017), available at <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/demo/P60-259.pdf\">https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/demo/P60-259.pdf</a>.\n    However, consular officers will also review the support provided by \na parent or other source (assets, resources, and financial status) as \npart of the totality of the circumstances. For example, in the case of \na 17-year old child in a United States boarding school, consular \nofficers would consider age to be a negative factor. However, the \nalien's financial status or support, such as having education and \nliving expenses paid for by someone else, would be a positive factor \nthat in the totality of the circumstances could lead to the conclusion \nthat the applicant is not likely to become a public charge. Likewise, \nin the case of a 17-year-old who has a credible offer of lawful \nemployment that would make him- or herself-sufficient, the alien's age \nwould be a negative factor, but a credible offer of employment that \nwould make the alien self-sufficient would be a positive factor.\n    In codifying existing FAM guidance that an applicant's age above \nearly retirement age is a negative factor in the totality of the \ncircumstances if the consular officer believes it negatively affects \nthe person's ability to work or may increase the potential for \nhealthcare related costs, the Department does not intend this standard \nto imply that individuals over early retirement age are unable to work. \nThese factors\n\n[[Page 55002]]\n\nwill be weighed by consular officers in analyzing the totality of the \napplicant's circumstances.\nb. Health\n    The interim final rule generally restates FAM guidance that directs \nconsular officers to consider a visa applicant's health when assessing \nwhether the applicant is likely to become a public charge. As explained \nbelow, the rule introduces additional factors related to assets, \nresources, and financial status, including whether an applicant will \nhave health insurance or other means to cover reasonably foreseeable \nmedical costs (relating to health issues existing at the time of visa \nadjudication). Lack of health insurance alone would not make an alien \nmore likely than not to become a public charge at any time, but would \ninstead be considered in the totality of the alien's circumstances.\nc. Family Status\n    Under the interim final rule, consular officers will consider \nwhether the alien has a household to support, or whether the alien is \nbeing supported by another household and whether the alien's household \nsize makes the alien likely to become a public charge. Household size \nis a positive factor if the family size makes the alien unlikely to \nreceive public benefits at any time in the future.\n    The Department notes that consular officers will frequently view \nfamily status in connection with, among other things, the alien's \nassets and resources, because the amount of assets and resources \nnecessary to support a larger number of people in a household is \ngenerally greater. Thus, as described in the section below on ``Assets, \nresources, and financial status,'' consular officers will consider \nannual gross income for the applicant's household size of at least 125 \npercent of the most recent Federal Poverty Guidelines based on the \napplicant's household size (or 100 percent for an applicant on active \nduty, other than training, in the Armed Forces) a positive factor. The \nDepartment also recognizes DHS analyses showing that receipt of non-\ncash benefits generally increases as family size increases, and \ntherefore family size is relevant to assessing whether an alien is \nlikely to become a public charge. See Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds, 83 FR 51114, 51185, Tables 16 and 17 (proposed Oct. 10, 2018). \nRegardless of household size, an alien may present other factors (e.g., \nassets, resources, financial status, education, and skills) that weigh \nfor or against a finding that the alien is likely to become a public \ncharge. For instance, an alien who is part of a large household may \nhave his or her own income or access to additional assets and resources \nthat would assist in supporting the household. All of these factors \nwould be considered in the totality of the circumstances.\n    The Department notes that this approach deviates somewhat from the \nDHS rule, in that the Department's approach focuses on the alien's \nintended household in the United States, rather than any members of his \nforeign household he or she will leave behind. This difference in \neffect aligns the two Departments' approaches.\nd. Assets, Resources, and Financial Status\n    The Department's interpretation of this factor in the interim final \nrule comports with the totality of the circumstances test. Household \ngross income above 125 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for \nthe alien's household size (100 percent for an alien on active duty, \nother than training, in the Armed Forces), or assets five times the \ndifference between the applicant's household gross income and the \nFederal Poverty Guidelines for the applicant's household, is a positive \nfactor. However, if the alien is the spouse or child of a U.S. citizen, \nassets totaling three times the difference between the alien's \nhousehold gross income and 125 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines (100 percent for those on active duty, other than training, \nin the Armed Forces) for the alien's household size is a positive \nfactor. If the alien is a child who will be adopted in the United \nStates and who will likely receive citizenship under INA 320, 8 U.S.C. \n1432, then assets equivalent to or greater than the difference between \nthe alien's household gross income and 125 percent the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines (100 percent for those on active duty, other than training, \nin the Armed Forces) for the alien's household size is a positive \nfactor. This significant assets provision allows an alien whose income \nis below the applicable income threshold to demonstrate assets to \nsupport himself or herself, thereby reducing the likelihood of becoming \na public charge. This reflects a change from existing FAM guidance, \nwhich recognizes income above 125 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines and assets in the amount of five times 125 percent of the \nFederal Poverty Guidelines generally as sufficient resources for \novercoming public charge concerns. This new standard is more consistent \nwith DHS Affidavit of Support requirements, outlined in 8 CFR \n213a.2(c)(2)(iii)(B), and the framework DHS will use for public charge \ninadmissibility determinations. See 8 CFR 212.22(b)(4).\n    It is still possible that other factors, such as an alien's health \nand inability to pay for reasonably foreseeable health costs, could \nmean that a consular officer could find an alien with such financial \nresources likely to become a public charge. The Department recognizes \nthat this factor will be more relevant to immigrant visa applicants who \nwill reside permanently in the United States than nonimmigrant \napplicants who intend to travel to the United States for a short \nduration.\n    The interim final rule introduces two factors related to assets, \nresources, and financial status: Previous DHS fee waivers and health \ninsurance or other means to cover foreseeable medical costs. DHS fee \nwaivers are based on an individual's inability to pay. 8 CFR 103.7(c). \nA recently granted fee waiver is relevant to whether an applicant is \nlikely to become a public charge, although the factor is less relevant \nif the applicant's financial status has materially improved since the \nwaiver was granted. Additionally, a fee waiver granted by DHS is not \nconsidered as a factor in the public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination if the alien applied for and was granted a fee waiver as \npart of an application for a benefit request for which a public charge \ninadmissibility under section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4) \nwas not required.\n    The interim final rule's addition of private health insurance as a \nfactor relevant to assets, resources, and financial status reflects the \nfact that medical costs can be significant and certain public benefits \nare designed to help individuals with limited resources to cover \nmedical costs. The fact that an applicant has health insurance or other \nsufficient financial resources makes it less likely that an alien will \nresort to public benefits to cover medical expenses. A consular officer \nwill consider an alien's health insurance coverage or other financial \nresources, in light of reasonably foreseeable medical costs (those \nrelated to medical issues existing at the time of visa adjudication), \nin the totality of the applicant's circumstances. Lack of health \ninsurance alone would not make an alien more likely than not to become \na public charge at any time, but would instead be considered in the \ntotality of the alien's circumstances.\n    The Department also considered whether to include a visa \napplicant's credit score or credit report among the other factors \nrelevant to assets, resources, and financial status. The\n\n[[Page 55003]]\n\nDepartment is aware that the DHS final rule includes an alien's credit \nhistory and credit score among the types of evidence USCIS adjudicators \nconsider. The Department did not include credit history or credit score \nin this interim final rule, primarily because visa applicants generally \nwould not have an active or recent credit history in the United States.\n    The interim final rule codifies some changes to how consular \nofficers will consider past receipt of public benefits. Current \nguidance directs consular officers to consider receipt of public \nassistance of any type by the visa applicant or a family member in the \nvisa applicant's household when determining the likelihood a visa \napplicant would become a public charge. The interim final rule revises \nthis by focusing on receipt of public benefits only by the applicant \nand incorporates the Department's new definition of public benefit. \nBoth of these elements align with the DHS rule, ensure consistent \nadministration of the INA's public charge provisions, and minimize the \npossibility of a consular officer issuing a visa to an alien who is \nlater found to be inadmissible by DHS on the same facts.\n    The Department's new definition of ``public benefit'' includes only \ncertain forms of public assistance received on or after 12 a.m., \nOctober 15, 2019, although, as explained below in Section \n(II)(B)(1)(i), consular officers may consider any amount of cash \nassistance for income maintenance, including Supplemental Security \nIncome (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), State and \nlocal cash assistance programs that provide benefits for income \nmaintenance (often called ``General Assistance'' programs), and \nprograms (including Medicaid) supporting aliens who are \ninstitutionalized for long-term care, received, or certified for \nreceipt, before October 15, 2019 as a negative factor (but not a \nheavily weighted negative factor).\ne. Education and Skills\n    When considering an alien's education and skills, consular officers \nwill consider whether the alien has adequate education and skills to \neither obtain or maintain lawful employment with an income sufficient \nto avoid being likely to become a public charge. In assessing whether \nthe alien's level of education and skills makes the alien likely to \nbecome a public charge, the consular officer must consider, among other \nfactors, the alien's history of employment, educational level (high \nschool diploma or higher educational degree), any occupational skills, \ncertifications or licenses, and language proficiency. Current guidance \ndirects consular officers to consider the applicant's skills, length of \nemployment, and frequency of job changes, and permitted consular \noffices to consider work experience as evidence of skills. Although the \ninterim final rule does not treat work experience as evidence of \nskills, it does require that consular officers consider the alien's \nhistory of employment. Section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4), directs officers to consider the alien's education and \nskills. The interim final rule implements Congress's directive on this \nmandatory statutory factor. This formulation is also more similar to \nthe new DHS guidance, and is aimed to mitigate against situations where \na consular officer will issue a visa to an alien who is later found \ninadmissible by DHS on the same facts.\n    The interim final rule introduces a requirement that consular \nofficers consider the following additional information relevant to \neducation and skills: Educational level (high school diploma, or its \nequivalent, or higher educational degree), any occupational skills, \ncertifications or licenses, and language proficiency. Various studies \nand data show that a higher level of education and skills is a positive \nindicator of self-sufficiency. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \n(BLS) observed in 2016 a relationship between educational level and the \nunemployment rate. See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment \nProjections, Unemployment Rates and Earnings by Educational Attainment, \n2016, available at <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm</a> (last updated Mar. 27, 2018). According to that report, \nthe unemployment rate for an individual with a doctoral degree was only \n1.6 percent, compared to 7.4 percent for an individual with less than a \nhigh school diploma. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, lower \neducational attainment was associated with higher public benefit \nprogram participation rates for people over the age of 18. See Shelley \nK. Irving & Tracy A. Loveless, U.S. Census Bureau, Dynamics of Economic \nWell-Being: Participation in Government Programs, 2009-2012: Who Gets \nAssistance?

That report \nreflected that in 2012, 37.3 percent of people who did not graduate \nfrom high school received means-tested benefits, compared with 21.6 \npercent of high school graduates and 9.6 percent of individuals with \none or more years of college.\n    Additionally, data suggest that people who have lower education \nlevels are not only more likely to receive public benefits but also \nmore likely to receive them for longer periods. For example, 49.4 \npercent of people with less than four years of high school who received \npublic benefits from a major means-tested program between January 2009 \nand December 2012 continued to participate in the benefit program for \n37 to 48 months. In contrast, only 39.3 percent of high school \ngraduates and 29.0 percent of those with one or more years of college \nwho received public benefits during the same time period continued to \nparticipate in the public benefit program for 37 to 48 months. See id. \nThe data suggests that a lack of education increases the likelihood of \npoverty and unemployment, which may in turn increase the likelihood of \napplying for, and participating in, public assistance programs.\n    The Department's treatment of education and skills in the interim \nfinal rule is supported by DHS's analysis of Survey of Income and \nProgram Participation data, which shows a relationship between \neducation level and self-sufficiency. See Inadmissibility on Public \nCharge Grounds, 83 FR 51114, 51190-51196 (proposed Oct. 10, 2018).\n    The interim final rule recognizes the implications of whether the \nalien is a primary caregiver. This factor is intended to take into \nconsideration difficult-to-monetize contributions by aliens who may \nlack current employment or an employment history due to their full-\ntime, unpaid care of household members. For example, a visa applicant \nmay care for a household member who will not travel with the visa \napplicant to the United States. The visa applicant's employment history \nwould not accurately reflect the alien's unpaid work as a primary \ncaregiver. In this respect, serving as a primary caregiver could be a \npositive factor in the totality of the circumstances.\nf. Prospective Visa Classification\n    The interim final rule adds that consular officers will consider \nthe visa classification sought. This factor relates to the alien's \nability to financially support himself or herself and the members of \nhis or her household while in the United States. For example, a \nconsular officer's public charge analysis of an applicant for a B-1 \nnonimmigrant visa, who plans to attend a week-long business meeting, \nwould differ from a longer term nonimmigrant applicant, such as an H-1B \nnonimmigrant\n\n[[Page 55004]]\n\nspecialty worker, who would reside and work in the United States for \nyears at a time, and would differ even more from an immigrant visa \napplicant who intends to reside permanently in the United States and \nmay not have pre-arranged employment. In this respect, the visa \nclassification, including the purpose and duration of travel, are \nrelevant to assessing the likelihood that an alien would avail himself \nor herself of public benefits (noting that in many cases visa \napplicants may not be eligible for public benefits in the United \nStates), and therefore consular officers must evaluate these factors on \na case-by-case basis.\n    That is not to say that a B-1 nonimmigrant applicant is subject to \na lower standard than an H-1B nonimmigrant or immigrant under the \nstatute or this interim final rule, but the immigration status sought \nby the applicant will be highly relevant context for the consular \nofficer's totality of the circumstances determination. An applicant \nwith a serious chronic health condition seeking medical treatment in \nthe United States on a tourist visa would be expected to establish that \nhe or she has the means and intent to pay for all reasonably \nforeseeable treatment. By demonstrating the ability to cover the \nmedical expenses anticipated on a short-term trip to the United States, \nthe applicant can demonstrate that even though health presents as a \nnegative factor, the applicant has financial resources that make it \nunlikely the applicant would avail himself or herself of one or more \npublic benefits. However, an immigrant visa applicant with the same \nserious chronic health condition and need for ongoing treatment would \nhave to satisfy a consular officer that he or she has the means to pay \nfor long-term care.\ng. Affidavit of Support\n    The interim final rule provides that a properly filed, non-\nfraudulent, and sufficient Affidavit of Support, in those cases where \nit is required, is a positive factor in the totality of the \ncircumstances. In the totality of the circumstances review, the \nconsular officer would take into consideration the likelihood that the \nsponsor actually would provide the required financial support, based on \nthe any available relevant information about the sponsor. Since January \n2018, FAM guidance has reflected that a properly filed, non-fraudulent \nAffidavit of Support, in those cases where it is required, is a \npositive factor in the totality of the circumstances analysis, and that \nan alien who is required to submit an Affidavit of Support but who \nfails to submit a sufficient Affidavit of Support is ineligible as a \npublic charge. To be sufficient, an Affidavit of Support must meet the \nrequirements of 8 CFR part 213a. Also, in paragraph (b), the Department \nremoved reference to fee collection for review and assistance with \nsubmitting an affidavit of support at consular posts because consular \nposts do not collect an affidavit of support fee overseas.\nh. Heavily Weighted Factors\n    The interim final rule provides that certain factors or factual \ncircumstances will weigh heavily in determining whether an alien is \nlikely to become a public charge. The mere presence of one of these \nenumerated circumstances would not, alone, be determinative. A heavily \nweighted factor could be outweighed by countervailing evidence in the \ntotality of the circumstances. While heavily weighted factors are \ncircumstances the Department considers particularly indicative of the \nlikelihood an alien will become a public charge, they are evaluated in \nconjunction with other relevant positive and negative factors in the \ntotality of the alien's circumstances.\ni. Heavily Weighted Negative Factors\n    The interim final rule provides that certain factors are weighted \nas heavily negative because these factors are particularly indicative \nof a likelihood that the alien would become a public charge, \nparticularly with regard to the alien's ability to be self-sufficient. \nHeavily weighted negative factors include:\na. Lack of Recent Employment or Prospect of Future Employment\n    As long as an alien is not a full-time student and is authorized to \nwork in the alien's place of residence abroad and, if relevant, in the \nUnited States, the interim final rule sets the absence of current \nemployment, employment history, or reasonable prospect of future \nemployment as a heavily weighted negative factor. Self-sufficiency \ngenerally involves people being capable and willing to work and being \nable to secure and maintain gainful employment. Various studies and \ndata show that a person's education, skills, and employment history, \nare positive factors for self-sufficiency. See Section (II)(B)(1)(e), \nabove. In addition, the lack of positive employment history and \ndemonstrable marketable skills are indicative of an increased \nlikelihood that an individual would avail himself or herself of public \nbenefits. This concept is supported by two Census Bureau studies \ncovering 2004 to 2007 and 2009 to 2012, which show that, in each of the \ncovered years, individuals with full-time work were less likely to \nreceive means-tested benefits during the year (ranging from 4.5 percent \nto 5.1 percent of full-time workers who received benefits) than those \nwho were unemployed (ranging from 24.8 percent to 31.2 percent of \nunemployed individuals who received benefits). See Jeongsoo Kim, \nShelley K. Irving, & Tracy A. Loveless, U.S. Census Bureau, Dynamics of \nEconomic Well-Being: Participation in Government Programs, 2004 to 2007 \nand 2009--Who Gets Assistance? (July 2012), available at <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2012/demo/p70-130.pdf\">https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2012/demo/p70-130.pdf</a>; Shelley K. \nIrving & Tracy A. Loveless, U.S. Census Bureau, Dynamics of Economic \nWell-Being: Participation in Government Programs, 2009-2012: Who Gets \nAssistance? (May 2015), available at <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p70-141.pdf\">https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p70-141.pdf</a>. The Department \nrecognizes that not everyone authorized to work needs to work and thus \nthe Department does not require a working age alien to have an \nemployment history as part of the public charge determination. Some \naliens may have sufficient assets and resources, including a household \nmember's income and assets, which may overcome any negative factor \nrelated to lack of employment. For example, some student visa \napplicants may have scholarships that cover the cost of education as \nwell as living expenses during the time of their studies. Further, \nstudents generally acquire skills as part of their studies so that \npost-education they will be able to obtain employment. Consular \nofficers will review those considerations in the totality of the \ncircumstances.\nb. Current or Certain Past Receipt of Public Benefits\n    Under Sec.  40.41(a)(8)(i)(B), receipt of one or more public \nbenefits, as defined in Sec.  40.41(c), is a heavily weighted negative \nfactor in a consular officer's public charge determination if an alien \nhas received or has been certified or approved to receive one or more \npublic benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-\nmonth period, beginning no earlier than 36 months prior to the alien's \nvisa application or after October 15, 2019, whichever is later. Under \nthis interim final rule, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as \ntwo months' worth of benefits. Current receipt of one or more public \nbenefits, alone, will not always justify a finding of ineligibility on \npublic charge grounds. However, an alien's current\n\n[[Page 55005]]\n\nreceipt of one or more public benefits suggests that the alien may \ncontinue to receive one or more public benefits in the future and would \nbe more likely to be a public charge as defined under Sec.  40.41(b).\n    With regard to current receipt of public benefits, according to \nU.S. Census Bureau data, the largest share of participants (43.0 \npercent) who benefited from one or more means-tested assistance \nprograms between January 2009 and December 2012 continued to receive \nprogram benefits for between 37 and 48 months. See U.S. Census Bureau, \nNews Release: 21.3 Percent of U.S. Population Participates in \nGovernment Assistance Programs Each Month (May 28, 2015), available at \n<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html</a>. A \nseparate U.S. Census Bureau study showed that an individual who \nreceived benefits at any point during a two-year timespan was likely to \nreceive benefits every month during the period studied, suggesting \nrelatively long periods of receipt of benefits. Between January 2004 \nand December 2005, a greater share of the population received one or \nmore means-tested benefits for the entire 24-month study period (10.2 \npercent) than for either one to 11 months (8.5 percent) or 12 to 23 \nmonths (6.5 percent). See Jeongsoo Kim, Shelley K. Irving, & Tracy A. \nLoveless, U.S. Census Bureau, Dynamics of Economic Well-Being: \nParticipation in Government Programs, 2004 to 2007 and 2009--Who Gets \nAssistance? (July 2012), available at <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2012/demo/p70-130.pdf\">https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2012/demo/p70-130.pdf</a>. The Department views current \nreceipt of public benefits as a strong indicator that an alien will \ncontinue to receive public benefits after admission to the United \nStates and is, therefore, likely to become a public charge. However, an \nalien may be able to establish circumstances indicating that the \nreceipt of public benefits will stop in the near future, prior to \nadmission to the United States on the visa being sought.\n    An alien's past receipt of public benefits at any time on or after \nOctober 15, 2019, for more than 12 months in the aggregate within the \n36 months immediately preceding his or her application is a heavily \nweighted negative factor in determining whether the alien is likely to \nbecome a public charge. However, an alien's past receipt of T any \ndesignated public benefits is considered a negative factor, even if not \na heavily weighted one. For example, the receipt of a public benefit \nfive years ago (assuming the evaluation was on or after October 1, \n2024) would be a negative factor; however, a public benefit received \nwithin the previous three years prior to the visa application and for \nmore than twelve months (assuming the twelve months occurred after \nOctober 15, 2019 and was for more than 12 of 36 months in the \naggregate) is considered a heavily weighted negative factor. The weight \ngiven to the receipt of public benefits will depend not only on how \nlong ago and for how long the alien received the benefits, but also on \nwhether the alien received multiple benefits.\n    The interim final rule makes clear that consular officers will only \nconsider past receipt of public benefits on or after October 15, 2019, \nas a heavily weighted negative factor. The definition of ``public \nbenefit'' in Sec.  40.41(c) only applies to benefits received on or \nafter October 15, 2019.\nc. Lack of Financial Means to Pay for Medical Costs\n    An alien presents a high risk of becoming a public charge if he or \nshe does not have private health insurance and also lacks the prospect \nof obtaining private health insurance or the financial resources to pay \nfor reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to an existing medical \ncondition. The risk increases if the alien is likely to require \nextensive medical treatment or institutionalization or the condition \nwill interfere with the alien's ability to provide care for him- or \nherself, to attend school, or to work. If the applicant has no medical \nconditions existing at the time of visa adjudication, he or she would \nhave no reasonably foreseeable medical costs.\n    Certain chronic medical conditions can be costly to treat and an \nalien is a high risk of incurring significant medical costs if he or \nshe has such a condition. See U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., \nResearch In Action, Issue #19: The High Concentration of U.S. Health \nCare Expenditures (June 2006), available at <a href=\"https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/costs/expriach/expendria.pdf\">https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/costs/expriach/expendria.pdf</a>; see also \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/costs/index.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/costs/index.htm</a> (costs \nassociated with certain chronic diseases).\n    Certain conditions may adversely affect an applicant's ability and \ncapacity to obtain and retain gainful employment. Other conditions \ncould result in long-term institutionalization in a health care \nfacility. Id. According to the Multiple Chronic Conditions Chartbook \n2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Data, 86 percent of the nation's \n$2.7 trillion annual health care expenditures were for individuals with \nchronic or mental health conditions. Id. Consular officers will learn \nof medical conditions through panel physician medical examinations or \nthe alien's disclosure of a medical condition. If a consular officer \nhas reason to believe a visa applicant's medical condition will require \nextensive medical treatment or institutionalization, or will interfere \nwith the alien's ability to provide for himself or herself, attend \nschool, or work, the consular officer will require the visa applicant \nto explain how he or she will cover medical costs in the United States. \nIt is a heavily weighted negative factor if such an alien does not have \nprivate health insurance to cover such expenses in the United States \nand has neither the prospect of obtaining private health insurance to \ncover medical expenses in the United States, nor the financial \nresources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to \nsuch medical condition.\nd. Prior Public Charge Inadmissibility or Deportability Finding\n    A prior finding by an Immigration Judge or the Board of Immigration \nAppeals that the visa applicant was inadmissible under INA 212(a)(4), 8 \nU.S.C. 1182(a)(4), or deportable under INA 237(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. \n1227(a)(5) (for having become a public charge within five years after \ndate of entry to the United States, not from causes affirmatively shown \nto have arisen since entry) is a heavily weighted negative factor; \nhowever, a past public charge finding is not necessarily dispositive of \nwhether the individual subsequently will be denied a visa on public \ncharge grounds. The Department recognizes that individual circumstances \ncan change with the passage of time. This approach aligns with the DHS \nfinal rule.\nii. Heavily Weighted Positive Factors\n    The interim final rule provides that certain factors will be \nweighted as heavily positive, because they strongly indicate the alien \nwould not become a public charge. Heavily weighted positive factors \ninclude:\na. Alien's Household Has Income, Assets, Resources, or Support of at \nLeast 250 Percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines\n    If the alien's household has financial assets, resources, support \nor annual income of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines for the alien's household size, then that will be considered \na heavily weighted positive factor in the totality of the \ncircumstances. DHS's analysis of Survey of Income and Program \nParticipation data on income and participation in public benefit \nprograms shows that participation in programs that\n\n[[Page 55006]]\n\nadminister ``public benefits,'' as defined for the purpose of this \nrule, declines significantly for individuals with an income at least \n250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. See Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 83 FR 51206, (October 10, 2018) (noting, e.g., \nthat use of SNAP benefits declines from a 21.2 percent participation \nrate for those with income between 125-250 percent of the Federal \nPoverty Guidelines to 15 percent for those with incomes between 250-400 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines). This approach aligns with \nthe DHS final rule. Accordingly, the Department will treat income, \nassets, resources, or support that is at least 250 percent of the \nFederal Poverty Guidelines as a heavily weighted positive factor.\nb. Alien With Work Authorization Has Income of at Least 250 Percent of \nthe Federal Poverty Guidelines\n    The Department will consider an alien with work authorization and \nincome of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines as a \nheavily weighted positive factor. In addition to the reasons provided \nin the prior paragraph, this level of income suggests that the alien \nhas obtained a level of self-sufficiency and that he or she would be \nless likely to become a public charge, barring unforeseen changes in \ncircumstances. This aligns with the DHS final rule.\nc. Alien Has Private Health Insurance\n    Additionally, consular officers will consider as a heavily weighted \npositive factor that an alien is covered by private health insurance \n(other than health insurance obtained with premium tax credits under \nthe Affordable Care Act) that can be used in the United States during \nthe entire period of the alien's anticipated stay in the United States. \nThis approach is supported by DHS's analysis of Survey of Income and \nProgram Participation data, which indicates that the fact that an alien \nhas health insurance is indicative of the alien's ability to be self-\nsufficient. See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 FR 41292, \n41449 (Aug. 14, 2019). In excluding health insurance obtained with \npremium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act from the category of \nheavily weighted positive factors, though not from consideration as a \npositive factor, the Department observes that DHS adopted this approach \nin its final rule.\ni. Treatment of Benefits Received Before October 15, 2019\n    Under the interim final rule, consular officers will consider, as a \nnegative factor, but not as a heavily weighted negative factor, any \namount of cash assistance for income maintenance, including \nSupplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies (TANF), State and local cash assistance programs that provide \nbenefits for income maintenance (often called ``General Assistance'' \nprograms), and programs (including Medicaid) supporting aliens who are \ninstitutionalized for long-term care, received, or certified for \nreceipt, before October 15, 2019. This is reflective of the fact that \nunder previous Department guidance in effect since May 1999, consular \nofficers considered an applicant likely to become a public charge if \nthe applicant was likely, at any time after admission, to become \nprimarily dependent on the U.S. Government (which includes Federal, \nstate, or local governments) for subsistence. However, the mere receipt \nof these benefits does not automatically make an alien ineligible for \nthe visa. Consular officers will make each determination on a case-by-\ncase basis in the context of the totality of the circumstances. The \nDepartment will not consider as a negative factor any other public \nassistance received, or certified for receipt, before October 15, 2019.\n2. Public Charge Definition\n    The Department's interim final rule interprets public charge as the \nreceipt of one or more public benefits, as defined in paragraph (b) of \nSec.  40.41, for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-\nmonth period. Receipt of two benefits in one month counts as receiving \nbenefits for two months. Prior Department guidance limited the \ninterpretation of ``likely to become a public charge'' to ``likely to \nbecome primarily dependent on the U.S. Government (which includes \nFederal, state, or local governments) for subsistence'' (previously \nmeaning receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or \ninstitutionalization for long-term care at U.S. Government expense). \nThe Department believes this new, more rigorous implementation of the \npublic charge visa ineligibility is consistent with section 212(a)(4) \nof the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), and congressional objectives stated in \nthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 (PRWORA), \nwhere Congress noted that aliens subject to the public charge visa \nineligibility should ``not depend on public resources to meet their \nneeds, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of \ntheir families, their sponsors, and private organizations.'' See 8 \nU.S.C. 1601(2)(A).\n    There is a scarcity of legislative guidance and case law \ninterpreting public charge. Legislative history, however, suggests a \nlink between public charge and the receipt of public benefits. \nAccording to a 1950 Senate Judiciary Committee report, which led up to \npassage of the INA in 1952, a Senate subcommittee highlighted concerns \nraised by an immigration inspector about aliens receiving old age \nassistance. The Senate subcommittee recommended against establishing a \nstrict statutory definition of public charge. Because the circumstances \nthat indicate any given individual's likelihood of becoming a public \ncharge vary, the subcommittee instead recommended that the \ndetermination of whether an alien is likely to become a public charge \nshould rest within the discretion of consular officers and the \nCommissioner. See 1950 Omnibus Report of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, S. Rep. No. 81-1515, at 349 (1950).\n    In setting the standard as receipt of public benefits for more than \n12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period (such that, for \ninstance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months' \nworth of benefits) the Department recognizes that States have developed \nwidely varying approaches to the imposition of time limits for the \nreceipt of public benefits. On the Federal level, PRWORA established a \n60-month time limit on the receipt of federally funded Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) program benefits. See 42 U.S.C. \n608(a)(7) and 45 CFR 264.1. Some states have adopted shorter lifetime \nlimits on benefit receipt; in 2017, fourteen States had lifetime limits \nof less than 60 months and nine states had intermittent time limits. \nSee Heffernan, Christine, Benjamin Goehring, Ian Hecker, Linda \nGiannarelli, and Sarah Minton (2018). Welfare Rules Databook: State \nTANF Policies as of July 2017, OPRE Report 2018- 109, Washington, DC: \nOffice of Planning, Research, and Evaluation, Administration for \nChildren and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n<a href=\"https://wrd.urban.org/wrd/data/databooks/2017%20Welfare%20Rules%20Databook%20\">https://wrd.urban.org/wrd/data/databooks/2017%20Welfare%20Rules%20Databook%20</a>(final%2010%2031%2018).pdf (last \nvisited Sept. 13, 2019).\n    The Department's position is that an individual who receives public \nbenefits for more than 12 months, in the aggregate, during a 36-month \nperiod is\n\n[[Page 55007]]\n\nneither self-sufficient nor on the road to achieving self-sufficiency, \nand may appropriately be considered a public charge. The Department's \nimplementation deems receipt of public benefits for such a duration as \nexceeding what could reasonably be defined as a nominal level of \nsupport that merely supplements an alien's independent ability to meet \nhis or her basic living needs. This new definition aligns with the new \nDHS rule.\n3. Public Benefit\n    In general: As described above, the Department's prior guidance \ninterpreted the public charge ground of ineligibility to include only \npublic cash assistance for income maintenance and institutionalization \nfor long-term care at U.S. Government expense. Guidance on public cash \nassistance for income maintenance was further clarified to include \nsupplemental security income (SSI); TANF cash assistance, but not \nsupplemental cash benefits or any non-cash benefits provided under \nTANF; and state and local cash assistance programs that provide for \nincome maintenance (often referenced as ``state general assistance''). \nThis previous guidance explicitly excluded other benefits including \nnon-cash benefits such as the SNAP, Medicaid, housing vouchers and \nother housing subsidies, and other programs. The Department adopted \nthis interpretation based on an INS interpretation of the public charge \ninadmissibility, as explained in the INS Notice, Field Guidance on \nDeportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689 \n(May 26, 1999).\n    The new rule broadens the Department's interpretation of ``public \nbenefit'' for purposes of applying the public charge ground of \nineligibility to include public cash assistance for income maintenance, \nSNAP, most forms of Medicaid, Section 8 Housing Assistance under the \nHousing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program, Section 8 Project-Based Rental \nAssistance, and certain other forms of subsidized housing.\n    The Department believes this interpretation of public benefit is \nconsistent with INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). The sparse \nstatutory language and legislative history allows for a wide range of \ninterpretations, including both the Department's previous more limited \ndefinition of public benefit focused on cash assistance and this \nbroader definition.\n    The definition of ``public benefit'' in this interim final rule is \nalso consistent with PRWORA. That statute includes broad definitions of \n``federal public benefit'' and ``state or local public benefit'' that \nextend significantly beyond the Department's prior guidance in the \npublic charge context. While PRWORA allows some aliens to receive \ncertain benefits covered under its expansive definitions, Congress did \nnot exclude the lawful receipt of such benefits from consideration for \npurposes of INA section 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). Further, the \nDepartment's definition of ``public benefit'' is consistent with the \nCongressional goals articulated in PRWORA, specifically that aliens \nsubject to the public charge visa ineligibility should ``not depend on \npublic resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own \ncapabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and \nprivate organizations.'' See 8 U.S.C. 1601(2)(A). The Department chose \nto include the specific non-cash benefits covered under the definition \nof ``public benefit'' because these benefits assist recipients in \nmeeting basic living requirements, namely food, housing, and medical \ncare. The receipt of any of the listed benefits indicates that the \nrecipient, rather than being self-sufficient, needs the government's \nassistance to meet basic living requirements.\n    Since 1999, the Department, when applying the public charge \nineligibility ground, has considered only whether an alien is likely to \nbecome primarily dependent for subsistence on the U.S. Government, \nwhich includes Federal, state, or local governments, by resorting to \nincome maintenance and institutionalization for long-term care at \ngovernment expense. However, current FAM guidance says:\n\n    There are many forms of public assistance that an applicant may \nhave accepted in the past, or that you may reasonably believe an \napplicant might receive after admission to the United States, that \nare of a non-cash and/or supplemental nature and should not be \nconsidered to be benefits when examining the applicant under INA \n212(a)(4), and may only be considered as part of the totality of the \napplicant's circumstances in determining whether an applicant is \nlikely to become a public charge.\n\n    Under the interim final rule, the Department will only treat \nreceipt of the specified forms of public assistance on or after 12:00 \na.m., October 15, 2019 as a ``public benefit'' for the purposes of \napplying the public charge ground of ineligibility, and will only \nconsider cash assistance for income maintenance and programs supporting \ninstitutionalization for long term care in the United States that are \nnot included in the new definition of ``public benefit'' that were \nreceived or certified for receipt prior to October 15, 2019. The \nDepartment believes that consideration of these forms of assistance \nrepresent an appropriately comprehensive and also readily administrable \napplication of the public charge ground of ineligibility. The interim \nfinal rule will supersede the current policy, which allows consular \nofficers to consider past receipt of any forms of public assistance, at \nany time. The Department observes that DHS proposed a similar approach \nin its NPRM, but, following public comments, opted for the approach \nreflected in this interim final rule when it finalized its rule. For \nconsistency with the DHS standard, as well as for increased \ntransparency and to provide a clear and helpful limitation on the scope \nof review for consular officers and visa applicants, the Department is \nadopting the DHS final rule's approach.\na. Exception for Certain Individuals Enlisted or Serving in the U.S. \nArmed Forces, Spouse, and Children\n    Under the interim final rule, consular officers will not consider \nreceipt of public benefits by those enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces, \nor serving in active duty or in the Ready Reserve component of the U.S. \nArmed Forces, and their families, when assessing whether such \nindividuals are likely to become a public charge. The United States \nGovernment is profoundly grateful for the unparalleled sacrifices of \nthe members of our armed services and their families. The Department \nrecognizes that some service members, during their service, or their \nfamily members, qualify for and receive public benefits in addition to \nthe salary and benefits provided by the U.S. government. Their \nsacrifices, including risking life and limb, are so vital to the \npublic's safety and security that the Department finds this exception \nwarranted. The Department understands that many of the individuals who \nenlist in the military are early in their careers, and therefore, \nconsistent with statutory pay authorities, earn relatively low salaries \nthat are supplemented by certain other allowances and tax advantages \nprovided by the U.S. government. See Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds, 84 FR 41371; see also Final Rule, Inadmissibility on Public \nCharge Grounds; Correction, 84 FR 52357 (Oct. 10, 2019). This approach \nis consistent with the DHS rule. For these reasons, the Department's \ninterim final rule excludes consideration of the receipt of any public \nbenefits by active duty service members and their spouses and children.\n\n[[Page 55008]]\n\nb. Exception for Aliens Present in the United States in an Immigration \nCategory Exempt from the Public Charge Ground\n    For the purpose of immigration benefit adjudication, DHS does not \nconsider public benefits received by an alien during periods in which \nthe alien was present in the United States in an immigration category \nthat is exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility or for \nwhich the alien received a waiver of public charge inadmissibility. 8 \nCFR 212.21(b)(8). Likewise, for the purpose of adjudicating visa \napplications, consular officers will not consider public benefits an \nalien received during any periods in which the alien was present in the \nUnited States in an immigration category that is exempt from the public \ncharge ground of visa ineligibility, or if the alien was the recipient \nof a waiver of the public charge ground of ineligibility.\nc. Exception for Foreign-Born Children of U.S. Citizens\n    In some cases, the children of U.S. citizens will acquire \ncitizenship upon finalization of their adoption in the United States, \nunder section 320 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1431, or the children will \nnaturalize upon taking the Oath of Allegiance (or having it waived) \nunder section 322 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1433. In other cases, the \nchildren of U.S. citizens will acquire citizenship upon taking up \nresidence in the United States in the legal and physical custody of \ntheir U.S. citizen parent pursuant to a lawful admission. The \ndefinition of ``public benefits'' does not include any benefits that \nwere or will be received by aliens described in this paragraph.\n    Children of U.S. citizens eligible for automatic acquisition of \ncitizenship under section 320 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1431, are exempt \nfrom the affidavit of support requirement. See Child Citizenship Act, \nPublic Law 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631 (Oct. 30, 2000); 8 CFR \n213a.2(a)(2)(ii)(E). Therefore, consular officers will not require any \naffidavit of support forms from sponsors of visa applicants who will \nbenefit from section 320 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1431.\n    Children of U.S. citizens, including those adopted abroad, \ntypically receive one of several types of immigrant visas as listed \nbelow and are lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent \nresidence. Such children may become U.S. citizens (1) automatically, \n(2) following their admission to the United States and upon the \nfinalization of their adoption, or (3) upon meeting other eligibility \ncriteria. International adoptions vary depending on the laws of the \ncountry of origin, the laws of the U.S. State of residence, and \nmultiple other factors. In the majority of cases, adoptions are \nfinalized in the country of origin before the child enters the United \nStates and the child automatically acquires U.S. citizenship upon \nadmission to the United States. Children whose adoptions are not \nfinalized until after their admission or who were subject to custody \norders permitting immigration to and adoption in the United States do \nnot automatically acquire citizenship after admission. They may acquire \ncitizenship, however, upon completing an adoption in the United States \nor having the foreign adoption recognized by the State where they are \npermanently residing, after which they would be eligible to naturalize. \nSee U.S. Dep't of State, 2018 Annual Report on Intercountry Adoptions, \navailable at <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/Intercountry-Adoption/adopt_ref/adoption-publications.html\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/Intercountry-Adoption/adopt_ref/adoption-publications.html</a>.\n    The following categories of children acquire citizenship upon \nlawful admission for permanent residence and beginning to reside in the \nlegal and physical custody of their U.S. citizen parent(s):\n    <bullet> IR-2/IR-7 (Child of a U.S. citizen)--requires an approval \nof a Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative). These children, \nexcluding stepchildren who have not been adopted by the U.S. citizen \nparent, are generally lawfully admitted for permanent residence or \ntheir status is adjusted to that of lawful permanent resident. The \nchild must then file a Form N-600 (Application for Certificate of \nCitizenship) to receive the Certificate of Citizenship. The Certificate \ngenerally uses the date the child was lawfully admitted for permanent \nresidence.\n    <bullet> IR-3/IR-8 (Orphan adopted abroad by a U.S. citizen)--\nrequires an approval of the Form I-600 (Petition to Classify Orphan as \nan Immediate Relative). These children are generally admitted for \npermanent residence, and USCIS will send a Certificate of Citizenship \nto the child without a Form N-600 being filed or adjudicated.\n    <bullet> IH-3 (Hague Convention orphan adopted abroad by a U.S. \ncitizen)--requires an approval of the Form I-800 (Petition to Classify \nConvention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative). These children are \ngenerally admitted for permanent residence and USCIS will send a \nCertificate of Citizenship to the child without a Form N-600 being \nfiled or adjudicated.\n    The following categories of children are lawfully admitted for \npermanent residence for finalization of adoption:\n    <bullet> IR-4/IR-9 (Orphan to be adopted by a U.S. citizen). \nGenerally, the parent(s) must complete the adoption in the United \nStates. However, the child will also be admitted as an IR-4 if the \nforeign adoption was obtained without either parent having seen the \nchild during the adoption proceedings, or when the parent(s) must \nestablish that they have either ``readopted'' the child or obtained \nrecognition of the foreign adoption in the State of residence (this \nrequirement can be waived if there is a statute or precedent decision \nthat clearly shows that the foreign adoption is recognized in the State \nof residence). See 8 CFR 320.1.\n    <bullet> IH-4 (Hague Convention Adoptee to be adopted by a U.S. \ncitizen). These children are lawfully admitted for permanent residence \nand the parent(s) must complete the adoption in the United States. INA \nsection 101(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1101(b).\n    Furthermore, children of U.S. citizens, who are residing outside of \nthe United States and are eligible to naturalize under section 322 of \nthe INA, 8 U.S.C. 1433, must apply for an immigrant or nonimmigrant \nvisa to enter the United States before they naturalize. These children \nare generally issued a B-2 nonimmigrant visa in order to complete the \nprocess for naturalization through an interview and take the Oath of \nAllegiance under section 322 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1433. Congress has \nenacted numerous laws over the last two decades to ensure that foreign-\nborn children of U.S. citizens are not subject to adverse immigration \nconsequences in the United States on account of their foreign birth. \nMost notably, the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 provides that children, \nincluding adopted children, of U.S. citizen parents automatically \nacquire U.S. citizenship if certain conditions are met. See Dep't of \nState, FAQ: Child Citizenship Act of 2000, available at <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/Intercountry-Adoption/adopt_ref/adoption-FAQs/child-citizenship-act-of-2000.html\">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/Intercountry-Adoption/adopt_ref/adoption-FAQs/child-citizenship-act-of-2000.html</a> (last visited July 30, \n2019). See also 8 CFR part 320. The same year, Congress passed the \nIntercountry Adoption Act of 2000 (IAA), 42 U.S.C. 14901-14954, to \nimplement the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-\noperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, which established \ninternational standards of practices for intercountry adoptions. The \nUnited States signed the Convention in 1994, and the Convention entered \ninto force for the United States\n\n[[Page 55009]]\n\non April 1, 2008. Deposit of Instrument of Ratification by the United \nStates of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-\noperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, 72 FR 71730 (Dec. 18, \n2007). The full text of the Convention is available at <a href=\"https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=69\">https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=69</a> (last visited \nJuly 30, 2019). The IAA protects the rights of children, birth \nfamilies, and adoptive parents, and improves the Government's ability \nto assist U.S. citizens seeking to adopt children from abroad. IAA \nsection[thinsp]2, 42 U.S.C. 14901(a). See also Hague Convention on \nIntercountry Adoption; Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000; Accreditation \nof Agencies; Approval of Persons, 71 FR 8064 (Feb. 15, 2006).\n    Many U.S. citizens seek to adopt children with disabilities or \nserious medical conditions, and a significant proportion of children \nadopted abroad by U.S. citizens have special medical needs. U.S. \ncitizens seeking to adopt foreign-born children abroad generally must \nundergo a rigorous home study that includes a detailed assessment of \nfinances, emotional, mental, and physical health, and other factors to \ndetermine their eligibility and suitability as prospective adoptive \nparents. See 8 CFR 204.3(e), 204.311(g)(3). Accordingly, such parents \ngenerally will have sufficient financial resources to provide for the \nchild. See 8 CFR 204.311(h) (financial considerations); see also USCIS, \nHome Study Information, available at <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/adoption/home-study-information\">https://www.uscis.gov/adoption/home-study-information</a> (last visited July 30, 2019).\n    Nevertheless, many U.S. citizens who have adopted or are in the \nprocess of adopting foreign-born children with special medical needs \nmay seek Medicaid for their children. See Public Law 97-248, 96 Stat. \n324. Medicaid programs vary by State, and may be based on the child's \ndisability alone rather than financial means of the parents, or have \nhigher income eligibility thresholds. As enrollment in Medicaid \nprograms by children who are under 21 years of age will not be \nconsidered a ``public benefit'' for the purposes of this interim final \nrule, and because the adoptive parents have been found to have \nsufficient resources to meet the needs of their adoptive child, these \nvisa applicants will not be considered likely to become public charges. \nSpecifically, Congress has already imposed a requirement on adoptees \nunder INA sections 101(b)(1)(F) or (G), 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1)(F) or (G), \nthat requires their parents to demonstrate to the government that \n``proper care will be furnished the child if admitted to the United \nStates.'' Federal regulations already require submission of a home \nstudy in cases involving the proposed adoption of children with special \nneeds. The home studies in those cases must assess the adoptive \nparents' ``preparation, willingness, and ability'' to provide proper \ncare for such children. 8 CFR 204.3(e)(4) and 204.311(p). The \nDepartment believes that Congress, by imposing a parental suitability \ndetermination that must be satisfied before an immigrant petition may \nbe approved or a visa may be granted, has frontloaded aspects of the \npublic charge determination for certain adoptive children and conveyed \na preference that concerns directly related to public charge for \nadoptive families be assessed at early stages of the immigration \nprocess, rather than waiting until the time of the visa application at \nthe very end of the process. Additionally, excluding consideration of \nthe receipt of public benefits by such children is consistent with \nCongress' strong interest in supporting U.S. citizens seeking to adopt \nand welcome foreign-born children into their families, as reflected in \nthe IAA section[thinsp]2, 42 U.S.C. 14901(a). See also 146 Cong. Rec. \nS8938-01, S8938 (daily ed. Sept. 21, 2000) (statement by Sen. Landrieu) \n(``I have said it before and I believe it rings true here, adoption \nbrings people, whether they are Republican, Democrat, conservative, \nliberal, American, Russian or Chinese, together. United by the belief \nthat all children deserve to grow in the love of a permanent family. \nAdoption breaks down barriers and helps build families.''). See also \nPublic Law 106-139, 113 Stat. 1696 (1999) (amending the definition of \n``child'' in section 101(b)(1)(E) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1)(E), a \nchange that allowed children adopted abroad to maintain their familial \nrelationship with their natural siblings, making it easier for siblings \nto be adopted together).\n    Furthermore, because these children are being brought to the United \nStates by their U.S. citizen parents (including adoptive parents) and \nwill generally become U.S. citizens upon or after admission, and \nbecause the adoptive families have been found to have the resources to \ncare for them, such an interpretation is not at odds with Congress' \nconcerns in enacting PRWORA, or as reflected in concurrent immigration \nlegislation restating the public charge ground of visa ineligibility \nnoting that aliens should rely on their own capabilities and the \nresources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations; \nand that the availability of public benefits should not constitute an \nincentive for immigration to the United States. 8 U.S.C. 1601.\n    This provision also aligns with the DHS final rule. Accordingly, \nthe interim final rule excludes receipt of benefits by foreign-born \nchildren of United States citizens from its interpretation of ``public \nbenefits,'' as explained in Section I, above.\n4. Alien's Household\n    The federal poverty guidelines do not define how to determine \nhousehold size, and different agencies and programs have different \nrequirements. See Annual Update of the HHS Poverty Guidelines, 84 FR \n1167 (Feb. 1, 2019). Public benefit-granting agencies generally \nconsider an applicant's income for purposes of public benefit \neligibility and either use the household size or family size to \ndetermine the income threshold needed to qualify for a public benefit. \nEach federal program administrator or State determines the general \neligibility requirements needed to qualify for the public benefits and \nhow to determine whose income is included for purposes of determining \nincome based eligibility thresholds. For example, SNAP uses the term \n``household'' to include ``individuals who live together and \ncustomarily purchase food and prepare meals together for home \nconsumption.'' 7 U.S.C. 2012(m)(1). The Department did not incorporate \nthe SNAP definition because an alien may have significant financial \nobligations to children who do not reside in the same residence. \nInstead, the standard in the interim final rule takes into account \nindividuals for whom the alien or the alien's parent(s) or legal \nguardian(s) or other individual is providing at least 50 percent of \nfinancial support because such expenditure would have significant \nbearing on whether the alien has sufficient assets, resources, and \nfinancial status in the context of a public charge determination.\n    The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses the \nterm ``families,'' which includes:\n\n    [F]amilies with children and, in the cases of elderly families, \nnear-elderly families, and disabled families, means families whose \nheads (or their spouses), or whose sole members, are elderly, near-\nelderly, or persons with disabilities, respectively. The term \nincludes, in the cases of elderly families, near-elderly families, \nand disabled families, 2 or more elderly persons, near-elderly \npersons, or persons with disabilities living together, and 1 or more \nsuch persons living with 1 or more persons determined under the \npublic housing agency plan to be essential to their care or well-\nbeing.\n\n\n[[Page 55010]]\n\n\n42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(3). The U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (the 1937 Act), 42 \nU.S.C. 1437 to 1437zz-10, requires that dwelling units assisted under \nit must be rented only to families who are low-income[thinsp]at the \ntime of their initial occupancy. Section 3 of the 1937 Act also defines \nincome, with respect to a family, as:\n\n    [I]ncome received from all sources by each member of the \nhousehold who is 18 years of age or older or is the head of \nhousehold or spouse of the head of the household, plus unearned \nincome by or on behalf of each dependent who is less than 18 years \nof age, as determined in accordance with the criteria prescribed by \nthe Secretary [of Housing and Urban Development], in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Agriculture [. . .].\n\n42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(4), as amended by the Housing Opportunity Through \nModernization Act of 2016, Public Law 114-201, section 102, 130 Stat. \n782, 787 (2016). Beyond the statutory framework defining families, and \nas provided by the 1937 Act, HUD allows public housing agencies the \ndiscretion to determine particularities related to family composition, \nas determined under each public housing agency's plan.\n    ``Alien's household,'' under paragraph (e) of the interim final \nrule, encompasses many of the individuals identified in various HUD \ndefinitions of ``family,'' including spouses and children as defined \nunder the INA. The definition of child in INA section 101(b), 8 U.S.C. \n1101(b), generally includes unmarried persons under 21 years of age who \nare born in or out of wedlock, stepchildren, legitimated children, \nadopted children if adopted under the age of 16 or the age of 18 if \nnatural siblings of another adopted child. In addition, the \nDepartment's interpretation focuses on both individuals who the alien \nanticipates will live in the alien's home or physically reside with the \nalien in the United States, as well as individuals not living in the \nalien's home but for whom the alien and/or the alien's parent(s)/legal \nguardian(s) is providing or is required to provide at least 50 percent \nof financial support, whether in the United States or abroad.\n    The IRS defines ``dependent'' to include a qualifying child or a \nqualifying relative. See 26 U.S.C. 152; see also IRS Publication 501 \n(Jan 2, 2018), available at <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf\">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf</a>. \nThese tests generally include some type of relationship to the person \nfiling (including step and foster children and their children) whether \nor not the dependent is living with the person filing and the amount of \nsupport being provided by the person filing (over 50 percent). IRS \nPublication 501 (Jan 2, 2018), available at <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf\">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf</a>. In general, the dependent must also be a U.S. citizen \nor lawful permanent resident in order to qualify as a dependent for tax \npurposes. Id.\n    The IRS definition of ``dependent'' would generally exclude \nnonresident aliens. However Sec.  40.41(d) does not. This will result \nin a larger number of people being included than if the Department \ntracked the IRS's definition of ``dependent'' in order to more \naccurately capture the alien's actual financial obligations. As used in \nparagraph (d), ``alien's household'' also considers those individuals \nwho are supported by the alien and are themselves aliens, or those who \nmay be contributing to the alien's income, in order to determine \nwhether the alien's financial resources are sufficient to support the \nalien and other members of the alien's household. For example, if an \nalien resides with a younger sibling who is attending school and the \nalien provides 50 percent or more financial support for the younger \nsibling, that sibling is a part of the alien's household, even though \nthe younger sibling may be earning some wages from a part-time job. \nThose part-time wages would be counted toward the requisite income \nthreshold. Similarly, if the alien has an older sibling who is \nproviding 50 percent or more of financial support to the alien but not \nresiding with the alien, that older sibling would also be included in \nthe alien's household and his/her income counted toward the requisite \nincome threshold along with any income earned by the alien.\n    As used in Sec.  40.41(d), ``alien's household'' adopts the IRS \nstandard of the amount of support being provided to the individual (50 \npercent) as the standard for deeming an individual part of the \nhousehold in the public charge determination. See Internal Revenue \nServ., Dependency Exemptions, available at <a href=\"https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/content/globalmedia/4491_dependency_exemptions.pdf\">https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/content/globalmedia/4491_dependency_exemptions.pdf</a> (last visited \nJul. 30, 2019); see also Internal Revenue Serv., Table 2: Dependency \nExemption for Qualifying Relative, available at <a href=\"https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/content/globalmedia/table_2_dependency_exemption_relative_4012.pdf\">https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/content/globalmedia/table_2_dependency_exemption_relative_4012.pdf</a> (last visited Jul. 30, \n2019). The Department believes that the ``at least 50 percent of \nfinancial support'' standard used by the IRS is reasonable to apply to \nthe determination of who is a member of an alien's household, without \nregard to whether these individuals physically reside in the alien's \nhome. This would include those individuals the alien may not have a \nlegal responsibility to support but may nonetheless be supporting. For \nexample, this could include a parent, sibling, or a grandparent living \nwith the alien, or an adult child, sibling, or any other adult who the \nalien may be supporting or required to support or who contributes to \nthe alien's financial support.\n5. Receipt of Public Benefits\n    The interim final rule clarifies that receipt of public benefits \noccurs when a public benefit-granting agency provides a public benefit, \nas defined in Sec.  40.41(c), to the visa applicant as a beneficiary, \nwhether in the form of cash, voucher, services, or insurance coverage. \nThe Department clarifies that application or certification for a public \nbenefit does not constitute receipt of public benefits, but it may be \nconsidered as a factor suggesting likelihood of future receipt. \nLikewise, certification for future receipt of a public benefit does not \nconstitute receipt of public benefits, although it may suggest a \nlikelihood of future receipt. An alien's receipt of, application for, \nor certification for, public benefits solely on behalf of another \nindividual does not constitute receipt of, application for, or \ncertification for, such alien. This standard will help consular \nofficers implement the new ``public charge'' definition at Sec.  \n40.41(b) as an alien who receives one or more public benefits, as \ndefined in paragraph (c) of Sec.  40.41, for more than 12 months in the \naggregate within any 36-month period (such that, for instance, receipt \nof two benefits in one month counts as two months' worth of benefits). \nIt also clarifies that consular officers must evaluate whether the \nalien is likely to receive one or more public benefits, the impact of \ncertification for future receipt of public benefits, and that the \nrelevant consideration is the alien's receipt of public benefits, not \napplication or certification solely on behalf of another person.\n6. Deletion of Posting of Bond\n    The Department removed the provision in former 22 CFR 40.41(d), \nwhich said that a consular officer may issue a visa to an alien who is \nwithin the purview of INA 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), upon receipt \nof notice from DHS of the giving of a bond, and provided the consular \nofficer is satisfied that the giving of such bond removes the \nlikelihood that the alien will become a public charge. The Department \nis removing this provision because it reflects an obsolete process.\n\n[[Page 55011]]\n\n7. Deletion of Use of the Federal Poverty Line Where INA 213A Not \nApplicable\n    The Department removed the discussion in former 22 CFR 40.41(f), \nwhich stated that an immigrant visa applicant, not subject to the \nrequirements of INA 213A, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, and relying solely on \npersonal income to establish eligibility under INA 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4), who does not demonstrate an annual income above the Federal \npoverty line, as defined in INA 213A(h), 8 U.S.C. 1183a(h), and who is \nwithout other adequate financial resources, shall be presumed \nineligible under INA 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). The new language \nin sections (a) through (g) provide the framework consular officers \nwill use to assess the public charge visa ineligibility, including for \nimmigrant visa applicants who are subject to the public charge ground \nof ineligibility, but not the Affidavit of Support requirement. Instead \nof retaining a second framework for one subset of individuals subject \nto the public charge ground, the Department will apply this standard \nuniformly.\n8. Deletion of Joint Sponsor\n    The Department removed the discussion in former 22 CFR 40.41(g), \nwhich stated that submission of one or more additional affidavits of \nsupport by a joint sponsor is required if the relative sponsor's income \nand assets and the immigrant's assets do not meet the Federal poverty \nrequirements. This language has been deleted as it merely restates \nstatutory requirements of INA 213A, 8 U.S.C. 1183a, and as such is not \nnecessary in the 22 CFR 40.41.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department has concluded that the good cause exceptions in 5 \nU.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3) apply to this rule, as the delay associated \nwith notice and comment rulemaking would be impracticable, unnecessary, \nor contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B); 5 U.S.C. \n553(d)(3). Those exceptions relieve agencies of the notice-and-comment \nrequirement in emergency situations, or in circumstances where ``the \ndelay created by the notice and comment requirements would result in \nserious damage to important interests.'' Woods Psychiatric Inst. v. \nUnited States, 20 Cl. Ct. 324, 333 (1990), aff'd, 925 F.2d 1454 (Fed. \nCir. 1991); see also United States v. Dean, 604 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th \nCir. 2010); Nat'l Fed'n of Federal Emps. v. Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union, \n671 F.2d 607, 611 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\n    Notice and comment on this rule, along with a 30-day delay in its \neffective date, would be impracticable and contrary to the public \ninterest. On August 14, 2019, DHS published a final rule on \ninadmissibility on public charge grounds of inadmissibility. 84 FR \n41292. That rule, which will be effective October 15, 2019, changes how \nDHS interprets the public charge ground of inadmissibility, section \n212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4). Coordination of Department \nand DHS implementation of the public charge inadmissibility ground is \ncritical to the Department's interest in preventing inconsistent \nadjudication standards and different outcomes between determinations of \nvisa eligibility and determinations of admissibility at a port of \nentry. If implementation of the rule is delayed pending completion of \nnotice and comment, consular officers would apply public charge-related \nineligibility standards differing from those applied by DHS and, \nconsequently, might issue visas to applicants who would later arrive at \na port of entry and be found inadmissible by U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection under the new DHS public charge standards, based on the same \ninformation that was presented to the adjudicating consular officer. \nThis inconsistency between the two agencies' adjudications would create \na public harm and would significantly disrupt the Department's interest \nin issuing visas only to individuals who appear to qualify for \nadmission to the United States. The Department has determined that the \nneed to minimize the occurrence of situations in which visa holders \narrive at a port of entry and are found inadmissible under the new DHS \npublic charge standards supports a finding of good cause under 5 U.S.C. \n553.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    Because this interim final rule is exempt from notice-and-comment \nrulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Nonetheless, consistent with \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Department certifies that this rule \nwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities because this rule only regulates individual visa \napplicants and does not regulate any small entities or businesses.\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\n    The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined \nthat this is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866, 13563, and 13771\n\n    The new public charge standards will impose additional costs on \nmany individuals, by requiring applicants to provide detailed \ninformation about their age, health, family status, finances, and \neducation and skills. These costs are analyzed in the notice required \nunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of a new form, the DS-5540, Public \nCharge Questionnaire, which certain categories of applicants will be \nrequired to complete to help inform the consular officer's public \ncharge assessment. The Department is separately seeking OMB approval of \na new information collection (form) for this purpose. The Department \nestimates 12,736,034 visa applicants per year will be affected by this \ninterim final rule based on the average number of visa applicants \nsubject to the public charge ineligibility ground for the years 2017 \nand 2018. Specifically, in 2017, 624,317 immigrant visa applications \nwere subject to the public charge ineligibility ground. The number was \n630,340 in 2018. In 2017, 12,356,864 nonimmigrant visa applications \nwere in categories subject to the public charge ineligibility, and \n11,860,545 in 2018. While the Department estimates 12,736,034 visa \napplicants will be affected by this interim final rule per year, the \nDepartment estimates that only 450,000 applicants per year will be \nasked to submit this information; given that the majority of \nnonimmigrant visa applicants would not overcome 214(b) if they were \nalso deemed likely to be a public charge and thus would be refused as \nsuch. The average burden per response is estimated to be 60 minutes. \nThe Department estimates that the annual hour burden to visa applicants \nposed by the additional questions is 450,000 hours (450,000 applicants \nx 60 minutes). The weighted wage hour cost burden for this collection \nis $15,737,400 based on the calculation of $24.98 \\1\\ (average hourly \nwage) x 1.4 (weighted wage multiplier) x 450,000 hours.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Source: Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' May \n2018 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates for all \noccupations (<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\">http://www.bls.gov/</a>oes). Retrieved September 10, 2019.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Department believes the benefits of rigorously applying the \npublic charge ineligibility ground, informed by relevant information \nthat can only be provided by applicants, outweighs the costs associated \nwith the new rule. Visa applicants and their representatives will \nalready need to adjust to the new DHS\n\n[[Page 55012]]\n\npublic charge inadmissibility standard, so the information requested \nfor the purpose of enforcing the Department's new rule substantially \noverlaps with the information requested by DHS when the applicant \napplies for admission or other immigration-related benefits in the \nUnited States. Most importantly, this interpretation seeks to mitigate \nagainst the possibility that consular officers would issue a visa to an \nindividual who DHS would find inadmissible and deny U.S. entry, based \non the same facts. This benefits applicants by preventing the \ninvestment of time and expenditure of personal funds on travel to the \nUnited States in the event that DHS ultimately finds them inadmissible.\n    This rule is an E.O. 13771 regulatory action.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132: Federalism\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. The Department does not expect that this \ninterim final rule will impose substantial direct compliance costs on \nState and local governments, or preempt State law. The rule will not \nhave federalism implications warranting the application of Executive \nOrders 12372 and 13132.\n\nExecutive Order 12988: Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed the regulation in light of sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburden.\n\nExecutive Order 13175--Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have a \nsubstantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, will not impose \nsubstantial direct compliance costs on Indian tribal governments, on \nthe relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule imposes a new information collection requirements under \nthe provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. \nThe Department is separately seeking OMB approval of a new form, which \ncertain applicants will be required to complete to assist with the \nconsular officer's public charge assessment.\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 40\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, foreign relations, passports \nand visas, aliens.\n\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department amends 22 \nCFR part 40 as follows:\n\nPART 40--REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO BOTH NONIMMIGRANTS AND \nIMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 40 is revised to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1104, 1182, 1183a, 1641\n\n\n0\n2. Section 40.41 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  40.41  Public charge.\n\n    (a) Basis for determination of ineligibility. Any determination \nthat an alien is ineligible under INA 212(a)(4) must be predicated upon \ncircumstances indicating that, taking into account any Affidavit of \nSupport under section 213A of the INA that may have been filed on the \nalien's behalf, the alien is likely at any time to become a public \ncharge after admission, or, if applicable, that the alien has failed to \nsubmit a sufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA \nas set forth in either INA 212(a)(4)(C) or 212(a)(4)(D). Consular \nofficers will consider whether any identified third party is willing \nand able to financially support the alien while the alien is in the \nUnited States. When considering the likelihood of an alien becoming a \npublic charge at any time through receipt of public benefits, as \ndefined in paragraph (c) of this section, consular officers will use a \nmore likely than not standard and take into account the totality of the \nalien's circumstances at the time of visa application, including at a \nminimum: The alien's age; health; family status; assets, resources, and \nfinancial status; and education and skills. No one enumerated factor \nalone, apart from the lack of a sufficient Affidavit of Support under \nsection 213A of the Act where required, will make the alien more likely \nthan not to become a public charge. For immigration classifications \nexempt from the public charge ground of ineligibility, see 8 CFR \n212.23(a).\n    (1) The alien's age. Consular officers will consider whether the \nalien's age makes the alien more likely than not to become a public \ncharge in the totality of the circumstances, such as by impacting the \nalien's ability to work. Consular officers will consider an alien's age \nbetween 18 and early retirement age as defined in 42 U.S.C. 416(l)(2) \nas a positive factor. Age is a negative factor for aliens who are under \nthe age of 18. However, consular officers may consider other factors, \nsuch as the support provided to a minor child by a parent, legal \nguardian, or other source, that in the totality of the circumstances \nmay offset the alien's age as a negative factor. An alien's age above \nearly retirement age is a negative factor in the totality of the \ncircumstances, if the consular officer believes it adversely affects \nthe alien's ability to obtain or perform work, or may increase the \npotential for healthcare related costs that would be borne by the \npublic.\n    (2) The alien's health. Consular officers will consider whether the \nalien's health is a positive or negative factor in the totality of the \ncircumstances, including whether the alien, has been diagnosed with a \nmedical condition that is likely to require extensive medical care or \ninstitutionalization, or that will interfere with the alien's ability \nto provide and care for himself or herself, to attend school, or to \nwork, if authorized. Consular officers will consider the report of a \nmedical examination performed by the panel physician where such \nexamination is required, including any medical conditions noted by the \npanel physician. An individual with a Class B medical condition, \nincluding Class B forms of communicable diseases of public health \nsignificance, as defined in 42 CFR part 34, is not alone a \ndeterminative factor for public charge purposes. The medical condition \nwill be taken into consideration with all factors under the totality of \ncircumstances. In assessing the effect of the alien's health on a \npublic charge ineligibility determination, the consular officer will \nconsider evidence of health insurance or the ability to pay for \nreasonably foreseeable medical expenses in the United States a positive \nfactor in the totality of the circumstances.\n    (3) The alien's family status. When considering an alien's family \nstatus, consular officers will consider the size of the alien's \nhousehold, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, and whether the \nalien's household size is a positive or negative factor in the totality \nof the circumstances.\n    (4) The alien's assets, resources, and financial status--(i) In \ngeneral. Consular\n\n[[Page 55013]]\n\nofficers will consider, among other relevant factors, the following \naspects of an alien's assets, resources, and financial status:\n    (A) If the alien's annual gross income for the alien's household \nsize is at least 125 percent of the most recent Federal Poverty \nGuidelines based on the alien's household size (or 100 percent for an \nalien on active duty, other than training, in the Armed Forces), \nconsular officers will consider the alien's income a positive factor;\n    (B) If the alien's annual household gross income is less than 125 \npercent of the most recent Federal Poverty Guidelines (100 percent for \nthose on active duty, other than training, in the Armed Forces) based \non the alien's household size, consular officers will consider a total \nvalue of the household assets and resources that is at least five times \nthe difference between the alien's household gross income and 125 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for the alien's household \nsize as a positive factor. However, if the alien is the spouse or child \nof a U.S. citizen, assets totaling three times the difference between \nthe alien's household gross income and 125 percent of the Federal \nPoverty Guidelines (100 percent for those on active duty, other than \ntraining, in the Armed Forces) for the alien's household size is a \npositive factor. If the alien is a child who will be adopted in the \nUnited States and who will likely receive citizenship under section 320 \nof the INA, then assets equivalent to or greater than the difference \nbetween the alien's household gross income and 125 percent the Federal \nPoverty Guidelines (100 percent for those on active duty, other than \ntraining, in the Armed Forces) for the alien's household size is a \npositive factor.\n    (ii) Factors to consider. When considering an alien's assets, \nresources, and financial status, consular officers must consider \nassets, resources, and financial status including:\n    (A) The alien's household annual gross income;\n    (B) The alien's cash assets and resources;\n    (C) Non-cash assets and resources that can be converted into cash \nwithin twelve months of the visa application;\n    (D) The alien's financial liabilities;\n    (E) Whether the alien has applied for, been certified to receive, \nbeen approved to receive, or received one or more public benefits, as \ndefined in paragraph (c) of this section on or after October 15, 2019, \nor whether the alien has disenrolled or requested to be disenrolled \nfrom such public benefits.\n    (F) Whether the alien has received an immigration benefit fee \nwaiver from DHS on or after October 15, 2019, unless the fee waiver was \napplied for or granted as part of an application for which a public \ncharge inadmissibility under section 212(a)(4) of the Act was not \nrequired; and\n    (G) Whether the alien has private health insurance or other \nfinancial resources sufficient to cover reasonably foreseeable costs \nrelated to a medical condition in the United States.\n    (iii) Income from illegal activities or sources. Consular officers \nmay not consider any income from illegal activities or sources, such as \nproceeds from illegal gambling or drug sales, or income from any public \nbenefit listed in paragraph (c) of this section.\n    (5) The alien's education and skills. When considering an alien's \neducation and skills, consular officers will consider both positive and \nnegative factors associated with whether the alien has adequate \neducation and skills to either obtain or maintain lawful employment \nwith an income sufficient to avoid being likely to become a public \ncharge. In assessing whether the alien's level of education and skills \nmakes the alien likely to become a public charge, the consular officer \nmust consider, among other factors, the alien's history of employment, \neducational level (high school diploma, or its equivalent, or higher \neducational degree), any occupational skills, certifications or \nlicenses, and English language proficiency or proficiency in languages \nin addition to English. Consular officers will take into positive \nconsideration an alien who is a primary caregiver 18 years of age or \nolder who has significant responsibility for actively caring for and \nmanaging the well-being of a minor, elderly, ill, or disabled person \nresiding in the alien's household, such that the alien lacks an \nemployment history or current employment, or is not employed full time. \nOnly one alien within a household can be considered a primary caregiver \nof the same individual within the household.\n    (6) Prospective visa classification. When considering the \nlikelihood at any time of an alien becoming a public charge, consular \nofficers will consider the visa classification sought.\n    (7) Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the Act. Any alien \nseeking an immigrant visa under INA 201(b)(2), 203(a), or 203(b), based \nupon a petition filed by a relative of the alien (or in the case of a \npetition filed under INA 203(b) by an entity in which a relative has a \nsignificant ownership interest), shall be required to present to the \nconsular officer an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA \non a form that complies with terms and conditions established by the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. A properly filed, non-fraudulent, \nsufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, in those \ncases where it is required, is a positive factor in the totality of the \ncircumstances if the sponsor is likely to actually provide the alien \nwith the statutorily-required amount of financial support and other \nrelated considerations.\n    (8) Heavily weighted factors. The factors below will weigh heavily \nin an ineligibility determination based on public charge.\n    (i) Heavily weighted negative factors. The following factors will \nweigh heavily in favor of a finding that an alien is likely at any time \nin the future to become a public charge:\n    (A) The alien is not a full-time student and is authorized to work \nin his or her country of residence or the United States, as \nappropriate, but is unable to satisfy the consular officer that he or \nshe is currently employed, has recent employment history, or a \nreasonable prospect of future employment;\n    (B) The alien has received or has been certified or approved to \nreceive one or more public benefits, as defined in paragraph (c) of \nthis section, for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-\nmonth period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one \nmonth counts as two months' worth of benefits), beginning no earlier \nthan October 15, 2019, or for more than 12 months in the aggregate \nwithin the 36 month period prior to the adjudication of the alien's \nvisa application, whichever is later.\n    (C)(1) The alien has been diagnosed with a medical condition that \nis likely to require extensive medical treatment or \ninstitutionalization or that will interfere with the alien's ability to \nprovide for himself or herself, attend school, or work; and\n    (2) The alien has no health insurance for use in the United States \nand has neither the prospect of obtaining private health insurance for \nuse in the United States, nor the financial resources to pay for \nreasonably foreseeable medical costs related to such medical condition;\n    (D) The alien was previously found inadmissible or deportable on \npublic charge grounds by an Immigration Judge or the Board of \nImmigration Appeals.\n    (ii) Heavily weighted positive factors. The following factors will \nweigh heavily in favor of a finding that an alien is not likely at any \ntime to become a public charge:\n    (A) The alien's household has income, assets, resources, or support \nof at least\n\n[[Page 55014]]\n\n250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for the alien's household \nsize. Consular officers may not consider any income from illegal \nactivities, e.g., proceeds from illegal gambling or drug sales, or any \nincome derived from any public benefit as defined in paragraph (c) of \nthis section;\n    (B) The alien is authorized to work and is currently employed with \nan annual income of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines for the alien's household size. Consular officers may not \nconsider any income from illegal activities, e.g., proceeds from \nillegal gambling or drug sales;\n    (C) The alien has private health insurance (other than health \ninsurance obtained with premium tax credits under the Affordable Care \nAct) for use in the United States covering the expected period of \nadmission.\n    (9) Treatment of benefits received before October 15, 2019. When \nconsidering whether an alien is more likely than not to become a public \ncharge under this section, consular officers will consider, as a \nnegative factor, but not as a heavily weighted negative factor as \ndescribed in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, any amount of cash \nassistance for income maintenance, including Supplemental Security \nIncome (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), State and \nlocal cash assistance programs that provide benefits for income \nmaintenance (often called ``General Assistance'' programs), and \nprograms (including Medicaid) supporting aliens who are \ninstitutionalized for long-term care, received, or certified for \nreceipt, before October 15, 2019.\n    (b) Public charge. Public charge means, for the purpose of INA \n212(a)(4)(A) and (B), an alien who receives one or more public \nbenefits, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, for more than 12 \nmonths in the aggregate within any 36-month period (such that, for \ninstance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months' \nworth of benefits).\n    (c) Public benefit. (1) Public benefit means any of the following \nforms of assistance received on or after October 15, 2019:\n    (i) Any Federal, State, local, or tribal cash assistance for income \nmaintenance (other than tax credits), including:\n    (A) Supplemental Security Income (SSI), 42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.;\n    (B) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), 42 U.S.C. 601 \net seq.;\n    (C) Federal, State or local cash benefit programs for income \nmaintenance (often called ``General Assistance'' in the State context, \nbut which also exist under other names); and\n    (ii) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), 7 U.S.C. \n2011 et seq.;\n    (iii) Housing Choice Voucher Program, as authorized under section \n8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f);\n    (iv) Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate \nRehabilitation) authorized under section 8 of the United States Housing \nAct of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f);\n    (v) Medicaid under 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., except for:\n    (A) Benefits received for an emergency medical condition as \ndescribed in section 1903(v)(2)-(3) of Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct, 42 U.S.C. 1396b(v)(2)-(3), 42 CFR 440.255(c);\n    (B) Services or benefits funded by Medicaid but provided under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. 1400 et \nseq.;\n    (C) School-based services or benefits provided to individuals who \nare at or below the oldest age eligible for secondary education as \ndetermined under State or local law; and\n    (D) Benefits received by an alien under 21 years of age, or a woman \nduring pregnancy (and during the 60-day period beginning on the last \nday of the pregnancy).\n    (vi) Public Housing under section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 \n(42 U.S.C. 1437g).\n    (2) Public benefit, as defined in this section, does not include \nany form of assistance listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of \nthis section received by an alien who at the time of receipt of the \npublic benefit, or at the time of visa application or visa \nadjudication, is or was:\n    (i) Enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces under the authority of 10 \nU.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B) or 10 U.S.C. 504(b)(2), or\n    (ii) Serving in active duty or in the Ready Reserve component of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces, or\n    (iii) Is the spouse or child as defined in INA101(b), of an \nindividual described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, or \nof a citizen of the United States described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or \n(ii).\n    (3) Public benefit, as defined in this section, does not include \nany form of assistance listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of \nthis section received by an alien during periods in which the alien was \npresent in the United States in an immigration category that is exempt \nfrom the public charge ground of inadmissibility, as set forth in 8 CFR \n212.23(a), or for which the alien received a waiver of public charge \ninadmissibility from DHS. Public benefit does not include health \nservices for immunizations and for testing and treatment of \ncommunicable diseases, including communicable diseases of public health \nsignificance as defined in 42 CFR part 34.\n    (4) Public benefit, as defined in this section, does not include \nany form of assistance listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of \nthis section that were or will be received by:\n    (i) Children of U.S. citizens whose lawful admission as permanent \nresidents and subsequent residence in the legal and physical custody of \ntheir U.S. citizen parent will result automatically in the child's \nacquisition of citizenship;\n    (ii) Children of U.S. citizens whose lawful admission as permanent \nresidents will result automatically in the child's acquisition of \ncitizenship upon finalization of adoption; or\n    (iii) Children of U.S. citizens who are entering the United States \nfor the purpose of attending an interview under INA 322 in accordance \nwith 8 CFR part 322.\n    (d) Alien's household. For purposes of public charge ineligibility \ndeterminations under INA 212(a)(4):\n    (1) If the alien is 21 years of age or older, or under the age of \n21 and married, the alien's household includes:\n    (i) The alien;\n    (ii) The alien's spouse, if physically residing or intending to \nphysically reside with the alien in the United States;\n    (iii) The alien's children, as defined in INA 101(b)(1), if \nphysically residing or intending to physically reside with the alien in \nthe United States;\n    (iv) The alien's other children, as defined in INA 101(b)(1), not \nphysically residing or not intending to physically reside with the \nalien for whom the alien provides or is required to provide at least 50 \npercent of financial support, as evidenced by a child support order or \nagreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other order or \nagreement specifying the amount of financial support to be provided by \nthe alien;\n    (v) Any other individuals (including a spouse not physically \nresiding or intending to physically reside with the alien) to whom the \nalien provides, or is required to provide, at least 50 percent of the \nindividual's financial support or who are listed as dependents on the \nalien's United States federal income tax return; and\n    (vi) Any individual who provides to the alien at least 50 percent \nof the alien's financial support, or who lists the alien as a dependent \non his or her federal income tax return.\n\n[[Page 55015]]\n\n    (2) If the alien is a child as defined in INA 101(b)(1), the \nalien's household includes the following individuals:\n    (i) The alien;\n    (ii) The alien's children as defined in INA 101(b)(1), physically \nresiding or intending to physically reside with the alien in the United \nStates;\n    (iii) The alien's other children as defined in INA 101(b)(1) not \nphysically residing or intending to physically reside with the alien \nfor whom the alien provides or is required to provide at least 50 \npercent of the children's financial support, as evidenced by a child \nsupport order or agreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other \norder or agreement specifying the amount of financial support to be \nprovided by the alien;\n    (iv) The alien's parents, legal guardians, or any other individual \nproviding or required to provide at least 50 percent of the alien's \nfinancial support to the alien as evidenced by a child support order or \nagreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other order or \nagreement specifying the amount of financial support to be provided to \nthe alien;\n    (v) The alien's parents' or legal guardians' other children as \ndefined in INA 101(b)(1), physically residing or intending to \nphysically reside with the alien in the United States;\n    (vi) The alien's parents' or legal guardians' other children as \ndefined in INA 101(b)(1), not physically residing or intending to \nphysically reside with the alien for whom the parent or legal guardian \nprovides or is required to provide at least 50 percent of the other \nchildren's financial support, as evidenced by a child support order or \nagreement, a custody order or agreement, or any other order or \nagreement specifying the amount of financial support to be provided by \nthe parents or legal guardians; and\n    (vii) Any other individual to whom the alien's parents or legal \nguardians provide, or are required to provide at least 50 percent of \neach individual's financial support, or who is listed as a dependent on \nthe parent's or legal guardian's federal income tax return.\n    (e) Receipt of public benefit. Receipt of public benefit occurs \nwhen a public benefit-granting agency provides a public benefit, as \ndefined in paragraph (c) of this section, to the alien as a \nbeneficiary, whether in the form of cash, voucher, services, or \ninsurance coverage. Application or certification for a public benefit \ndoes not constitute receipt of public benefit, but it may be considered \nas a factor suggesting likelihood of future receipt. An alien's receipt \nof, application for, or certification for public benefit solely on \nbehalf of another individual does not constitute receipt of, \napplication for, or certification for such alien.\n    (f) Prearranged employment. An immigrant visa applicant relying on \nan offer of prearranged employment to establish eligibility under INA \n212(a)(4), other than an offer of employment certified by the \nDepartment of Labor pursuant to INA 212(a)(5)(A), must provide written \nconfirmation of the relevant information sworn and subscribed to before \na notary public by the employer or an authorized employee or agent of \nthe employer. The signer's printed name and position or other \nrelationship with the employer must accompany the signature.\n\nCarl C.

    "supplementary_information": "Why is the Department promulgating this rule?\n\n    The Adoptive Family Relief Act (Pub. L. 114-70) (the Act) amended \nSection 221(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \n1201(c), to allow for the waiver or refund of certain immigrant visa \nfees for a lawfully adopted child, or a child coming to the United \nStates to be adopted by a United States citizen (hereinafter referred \nto as adoptive children), subject to criteria prescribed by the \nSecretary of State. More than 350 American families have successfully \nadopted children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, \nsince September 25, 2013, some families have not been able to bring \ntheir adoptive children home to the United States because the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo suspended the issuance of ``exit \npermits'' for these children. As the permit suspension drags on, \nhowever, American families are repeatedly paying visa renewal and \nrelated fees, while also continuing to be separated from their adoptive \nchildren. The waiver or refund provides ``support and relief to \nAmerican families seeking to bring their adoptive children from the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo home to the United States, and would \nalso provide relief to similarly situated adoptive families should \nbarriers arise in other countries in the future.'' See 161 Cong. Rec. \nS2796-01.\n    The Department is amending current rules regarding immigrant visa \nfees found in Sec. Sec.  22.1, 42.71(b) and 42.74 of 22 CFR in order to \nimplement the Act. Thus, the current text of Sec.  42.71(b) will become \nSec.  42.71(b)(1) and a new paragraph (b)(2) will set forth the \nrequirements for the waiver or refund of immigrant visa fees for \nadoptive families who must renew a visa for an adoptive child who, \nthrough no fault of the parent(s) or child, is unable to travel to the \nUnited States. If an immigrant visa was issued on or after March 27, \n2013 and an adoptive child was unable to use that visa as a direct \nresult of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the \nadoptive child or adoptive parent(s), such as denial of an exit permit, \nthe adoptive child, adoptive parent(s), or their representative may \nrequest a waiver or refund of the immigrant visa fee relating to a \nreplacement of such visa. All other visa replacement requirements still \napply. This rule also adds this exemption to the Schedule of Fees at 22 \nCFR 22.1 and adds a paragraph at Sec.  42.74(a)(3) on replacement \nimmigrant visas for adoptive children covered by the Act.\n    In addition to implementing the Act, this rule also updates \nexisting regulations regarding immigrant visa application procedures to \nmore accurately reflect new technologies, application forms, and \nprocedures that have been implemented in recent years. Obsolete \nlanguage in Sec. Sec.  42.71, 42.73, and 42.74 regarding discontinued \nimmigrant visa issuance procedures and outdated forms has been deleted. \nSuperfluous language in Sec.  42.71 related to an outdated procedure \nhas been removed. Both Sec. Sec.  42.73 and 42.74 have been reorganized \nfor readability and Sec.  42.73 has been revised to more closely track \nthe equivalent provision to procure issuance of nonimmigrant visas at \nSec.  41.113. In addition, language related to the locations of \nspecific immigrant visa content on the Department's websites has been \ndeleted, as websites and their content are generally subject to \nfrequent reorganization and other changes. More specific guidance is \navailable in Volume 9 of the Foreign Affairs Manual (see <a href=\"http://fam.state.gov\">fam.state.gov</a>) \nand on <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov\">travel.state.gov</a>.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department is publishing this rule as a final rule, with an \neffective date less than 30 days from the date of publication, based on \nthe ``good cause'' exceptions set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and \n553(d)(3). The Department is issuing this final rule with an effective \ndate on the date of publication. The APA permits a final rule to become \neffective fewer than 30 days after the publication if the issuing \nagency finds good cause. 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). The Department finds that \ngood cause exists for an early effective date in this instance because \nCongress has already mandated that, subject to criteria prescribed by \nthe Secretary of State, the visa fees for certain lawfully adopted \nchildren may be waived, or, if paid, may be refunded. This rulemaking \nimplements the Congressional mandate.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    Because this final rule is exempt from notice-and-comment \nrulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Because this rule is exempt, \nthe Department did not conduct an economic analysis of the impact on \nsmall entities.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (codified at 2 U.S.C. \n1532) generally requires agencies to prepare a statement before \nproposing any rule that may result in an annual expenditure of $100 \nmillion or more by State, local, or tribal governments, or by the \nprivate sector. This rule will not result in any such expenditure, nor \nwill it significantly or uniquely affect small governments.\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\n    This rule is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\n\n[[Page 35298]]\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563\n\n    The Department has considered this rule in light of Executive \nOrders 12866 and 13563 and affirms that this regulation is consistent \nwith the guidance therein. The Office of Management and Budget has \ndesignated this rule not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. The \nDepartment does not consider this rule to be an economically \nsignificant rulemaking action.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. The rule will not have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nExecutive Order 13771--Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory \nCosts\n\n    This rule is not subject to the requirements of E.O. 13771 (82 FR \n9339, February 3, 2017) because it is not significant under E.O. 12866.\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to \nthis rulemaking.\n\nExecutive Order 12988\n\n    The Department has reviewed the regulation in light of sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburden.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This rule does not impose any new information collection \nrequirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 \nU.S.C. chapter 35. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \npreviously approved the application for a refund under the Adoptive \nFamily Relief Act (OMB Control No. 1405-0223).\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Parts 22 and 42\n\n    Consular services, Fees, Passports and visas.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, 22 CFR parts \n22 and 42 are amended as follows:\n\nPART 22--SCHEDULE OF FEES FOR CONSULAR SERVICES--DEPARTMENT OF \nSTATE AND FOREIGN SERVICE\n\n0\n1.

Section 42.71 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  42.71   Authority to issue visas; visa fees.\n\n    (a) Authority to issue visas. Consular officers may issue immigrant \nvisas at designated consular offices abroad pursuant to the authority \ncontained in INA 101(a)(16), 221(a), and 224.\n    (b) Immigrant visa fees--(1) Payment of fees. The Secretary of \nState prescribes a fee for the processing of immigrant visa \napplications. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, \nan individual registered for immigrant visa processing at a post \ndesignated for this purpose by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa \nServices must pay the fee upon being notified that a visa is expected \nto become available in the near future, and upon being requested to \nobtain the supporting documentation needed to apply formally for a \nvisa, in accordance with instructions received with such notification. \nThe fee must be paid before an applicant at a post so designated will \nreceive an appointment to appear and make application before a consular \nofficer. Applicants at a post not yet so designated will pay the fee \nimmediately prior to formal application for a visa. A fee collected for \nthe processing of an immigrant visa application is refundable only if \nthe principal officer of a post or the officer in charge of a consular \nsection determines that the application was not\n\n[[Page 35299]]\n\nadjudicated as a result of action by the U.S. Government over which the \nalien had no control and for which the alien was not responsible, which \nprecluded the applicant from benefitting from the processing, or as \nprovided in paragraph (b)(2).\n    (2) Waiver or refund of fees for replacement immigrant visas. The \nconsular officer shall waive the application processing fee for a \nreplacement immigrant visa or, upon request, refund such a fee where \nalready paid, if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien, the \nalien's parent(s), or the alien's representative has established that:\n    (i) The prior immigrant visa was issued on or after March 27, 2013, \nto an alien who has been lawfully adopted, or who is coming to the \nUnited States to be adopted, by a United States citizen;\n    (ii) The alien was unable to use the original immigrant visa during \nthe period of its validity as a direct result of extraordinary \ncircumstances, including the denial of an exit permit; and\n    (iii) The inability to use the visa was attributable to factors \nbeyond the control of the adopting parent or parents and of the alien.\n\n0\n5. Section 42.73 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  42.73  Procedure in issuing visas.\n\n    (a) Evidence of visa. An immigrant visa shall be evidenced by a \nphysical visa or by an electronic visa located in the Department's \nrecords. The appropriate symbol as prescribed in Sec.  42.11, showing \nthe classification of the alien, shall be entered on the visa.\n    (b) Visa format. A machine-readable visa shall be in the format \ndesignated by the Department, and contain, at a minimum, the following \ndata:\n    (1) Full name of the immigrant;\n    (2) Visa symbol;\n    (3) Location of the visa issuing office;\n    (4) Passport number;\n    (5) The registration number (A-number) assigned to the immigrant;\n    (6) Sex;\n    (7) Date of birth;\n    (8) Nationality;\n    (9) Date of issuance;\n    (10) Date of expiration;\n    (11) Visa control number;\n    (12) Any annotations entered to reflect waivers or other \ninformation useful to an immigration officer at a port of entry (POE) \nupon the immigrant's application for admission to the United States;\n    (13) A digitized photo of the immigrant; and\n    (14) Machine-readable data that can be processed by an immigration \nofficer at a POE.\n    (c) Disposition of supporting documents. Post shall, wherever \npossible, return original supporting documents furnished by the alien. \nDuplicate copies may be retained in the consular system, as required or \nnecessary.\n\n0\n6. Section 42.74 is revised to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  42.74  Issuance of new, replacement, or duplicate visas.\n\n    (a) New immigrant visa for a special immigrant under INA \n101(a)(27)(A) and (B). The consular officer may issue a new immigrant \nvisa to a qualified alien entitled to status under INA 101(a)(27)(A) or \n(B), who establishes:\n    (1)(i) That the original visa has been lost, mutilated or has \nexpired; or\n    (ii) That the alien will be unable to use it during the period of \nits validity; provided that:\n    (A) The alien pays anew the application processing fees prescribed \nin the Schedule of Fees (22 CFR 22.1); and\n    (B) The consular officer ascertains whether the original issuing \noffice knows of any reason why a new visa should not be issued.\n    (2) [Reserved]\n    (b) Replacement immigrant visa for an immediate relative or for an \nalien subject to numerical limitation. A consular officer may issue a \nreplacement visa under the original number of a qualified alien \nentitled to status as an immediate relative (INA 201(b)(2)), a family \nor employment preference immigrant (INA 203(a) or (b)), or a diversity \nimmigrant (INA 203(c)), if--\n    (1) The alien is unable to use the visa during the period of its \nvalidity due to reasons beyond the alien's control;\n    (2) The visa is issued during the same fiscal year in which the \noriginal visa was issued, or in the following year in the case of an \nimmediate relative only, if the original number had been reported as \nrecaptured;\n    (3) The number has not been returned to the Department as a \n``recaptured visa number'' in the case of a preference or diversity \nimmigrant;\n    (4) The alien pays anew the application processing fees prescribed \nin the Schedule of Fees; and\n    (5) The consular officer ascertains whether the original issuing \noffice knows of any reason why a new visa should not be issued.\n    (c) Replacement visa for adoptees. A consular officer may issue a \nreplacement immigrant visa to a qualified alien, if the conditions in \nparagraphs (a)(1) and (3) of this section are met, and if the consular \nofficer determines--\n    (1) A prior immigrant visa was issued on or after March 27, 2013, \nto a child who has been lawfully adopted, or who is coming to the \nUnited States to be adopted, by a United States citizen;\n    (2) The inability to use the visa was attributable to factors \nbeyond the control of the adoptee or the adopting parent(s); and\n    (3) The application processing fee has been waived pursuant to \nSec.  42.71(b)(2) or has been paid anew.\n    (d) Duplicate visas issued within the validity period of the \noriginal visa. If the validity of a visa previously issued has not yet \nterminated and the original visa has been lost or mutilated, a \nduplicate visa may be issued containing all of the information \nappearing on the original visa, including the original issuance and \nexpiration dates. The applicant shall execute a new application and \nprovide copies of the supporting documents submitted in support of the \noriginal application. The alien must pay anew the application \nprocessing fees prescribed in the Schedule of Fees.\n\nCarl C.

    "supplementary_information": "What changes are in the amended rule?\n\n    The Diversity Visa Program (``DV Program'') is administered \nannually by the Department of State (``Department''). Section 203(c) of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''), 8 U.S.C. 1153(c), \nprovides for a class of immigrants known as ``diversity immigrants'' \nfrom countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United \nStates. An estimated 14 million aliens register annually for the DV \nProgram through an electronic entry form. The entry form collects \ninformation on the petitioner's full name; date and place of birth; \ngender; native country, if different from place of birth; current \nmailing address; and location of the consular post where the diversity \nvisa should be adjudicated, if the petitioner is selected through the \nDV lottery. The electronic entry form also collects information about \nthe names, dates and places of birth for the petitioner's spouse and \nchildren. The entry process is open to all aliens who are natives of \n``low-admission'' countries without numerical limitation, defined as \ncountries with fewer than 50,000 natives admitted to the United States \nduring the most recent five-year period. After the close of the DV \nProgram entry period, petitioners are selected through a randomized \ncomputer drawing (``selectees'') for consideration for one of the \n50,000 available diversity visa numbers. While INA 201(d) authorizes \nallocation of 55,000 diversity visas annually, 5,000 of those visas are \nallocated each year for use under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act. See Public Law 105-100, Sec.  203(d) (INA Sec.  \n201 note) (1997). Selectees may then apply for a diversity visa or, if \npresent in the United States, apply for adjustment of status. To \nqualify for a visa, these selectees must meet certain requirements, \nincluding those provided for at INA 203(c), 8 U.S.C. 1153(c).\n    Section 204(a)(1)(I)(iii) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(I)(iii), \nvests the Secretary of State with authority to set by regulation the \ninformation and documentary evidence to support a petition for entry \ninto the DV Program. The requirements are set out in 22 CFR 42.33.\n    With this rule, the Department is amending 22 CFR 42.33(b)(1) to \nrequire the petitioner to include on the electronic diversity visa \nentry form the unique serial or issuance number associated with the \npetitioner's valid, unexpired passport; country or authority of \npassport issuance; and passport expiration date. These requirements \nwill apply only to the principal petitioner and not derivatives listed \non the entry form. These requirements apply unless the petitioner is \neither stateless, a national of a Communist-controlled country and \nunable to obtain a passport from the government of the Communist-\ncontrolled country, or the beneficiary of an individual waiver approved \nby the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State, \nconsistent with the passport waivers for immigrant visa applicants \nprovided for in 22 CFR 42.2(d), (e), and (g)(2). A petitioner who does \nnot have a passport and is either stateless, is a national of a \nCommunist-controlled country and unable to obtain a passport from the \ngovernment of the Communist-controlled country, or has an individual \nwaiver of the passport\n\n[[Page 25990]]\n\nrequirement from the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary \nof State, must indicate that he or she falls into one of these three \ncircumstances on the electronic entry form, instead of providing \npassport information. The requirements for information from a valid \npassport will not be waived under any other circumstances.\n    The Department is also clarifying that failure to accurately \ninclude any information required by 22 CFR 42.33(b)(1) and (2) will \nresult in mandatory disqualification of the petitioner for that fiscal \nyear. The existing regulations require the petitioner to submit \nspecific information, including, but not limited to: Name, date of \nbirth, and place of birth for the principal petitioner and any \nrelatives that may accompany the petitioner, if selected to apply for a \ndiversity visa, as well as a digital photo. While these are currently \nrequirements for the diversity visa entry form, existing regulations do \nnot make clear the consequence for failure to provide the information. \nThe revised regulation clarifies that failure to provide the required \ninformation, including a compliant photograph, will result in the \ndisqualification of the entry, the petitioner, and derivatives from the \nDV Program for that fiscal year.\n\nWhy is the Department promulgating this rule?\n\n    The Department has historically encountered significant numbers of \nfraudulent entries for the DV Program each year, including entries \nsubmitted by criminal enterprises on behalf of individuals without \ntheir knowledge. Individuals or entities that submit unauthorized \nentries will often contact unwitting individuals whose identities were \nused on selected DV Program entries, inform them of the opportunity to \napply for a diversity visa, and hold the entry information from the \nnamed petitioner in exchange for payment. Requiring that each entry \nform include a valid passport number at the time of the DV Program \nentry will make it more difficult for third parties to submit \nunauthorized entries, because third parties are less likely to have \nindividuals' passport numbers. Entries submitted by unauthorized third \nparties using a duplicative passport number will also be easily \nidentified and automatically disqualified.\n    The Department is also adding a sentence to the regulation to \nclarify that entries, and the individual identified as the entrant, are \ndisqualified if they fail to include all required information and \ncomply with instructions. This will provide increased transparency to \nDV Program entrants who might question why their entry was \ndisqualified, by explaining that disqualification will result from \nfailure to submit required information. While all DV entrants must \nsubmit a completed entry form to qualify for selection in the DV \nlottery, current instructions are not clear that failure to provide \nthat information results in mandatory disqualification. The information \ncollected on the entry form is vital to the integrity of the DV \nProgram, by ensuring the Department's ability to match the identity of \nDV lottery selectees and diversity visa applicants. Also, entry forms \nmust be complete and accurate to ensure that the Department is \nselecting entries from individuals who may be eligible for visa \nissuance. Providing clear notice that failure to accurately provide \nrequired information will result in disqualification will reduce the \nnumber of incomplete forms and reduce entries from individuals who will \nnot be eligible for visas, for example, because they cannot provide the \nrequired information.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act\n\n    The Department is publishing this rule as an interim final rule \nbecause it is exempt from notice and comment under the foreign affairs \nexception of the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA''), 5 U.S.C. \n553(a). This rule clearly and directly impacts a foreign affairs \nfunction of the United States. See City of N.Y. v. Permanent Mission of \nIndia to the U.N., 618 F.3d 172, 202 (2d Cir. 2010). Specifically, as \nexplained below, this regulation pertains to a visa program which \nserves as a clear tool of diplomacy and outreach to countries around \nthe world. Furthermore, this rule addresses a vulnerability in the \ncurrent application process by making it more difficult for third \nparties to submit fraudulent or unauthorized entries, a practice that \nhas significant negative consequences.\n    Under Section 204(a)(1)(I) of the INA, the Secretary has the \nauthority to determine the information or documents required for the \ndiversity visa application and prescribe regulations necessary to carry \nout the DV Program. This rule will add a requirement that foreign \nnationals seeking to enter the DV Program must provide valid passport \ninformation at the time of DV Program entry.\n    The DV Program was established to diversify the immigrant \npopulation in the United States, but it also serves as an outreach \ntool, as its focus is on building relations with foreign populations \naround the world, particularly with diversity visa eligible countries. \nDiversity visa-eligible countries qualify for that status based on \nlimited immigration to the United States by nationals of the country. \nConsequently, the DV Program is an important public diplomacy tool for \nthe Department of State, because it offers foreign nationals an \nopportunity to immigrate to the United States without having to qualify \nunder a more targeted family-based or employment-based classification. \nThis opportunity helps create allies and goodwill overseas, while \nsimultaneously promoting U.S. foreign policy interests. A program thus \ntailored to foster allies and goodwill overseas clearly qualifies as \nthe exercise of diplomacy. Therefore, this regulation is exempt from 5 \nU.S.C. 553 the APA because it involves a foreign affairs function of \nthe United States.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act/Executive Order 13272: Small Business\n\n    Because this interim final rule is exempt from notice-and-comment \nrulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553, it is exempt from the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Nonetheless, consistent with \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Department certifies that this rule \nwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities because this rule only regulates individual petitioners \nfor the DV Program and does not regulate any small entities or \nbusinesses.\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996\n\n    The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined \nthat this is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563\n\n    Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess costs \nand benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is \nnecessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits \n(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety \neffects, distributed impacts, and equity). These Executive Orders \nstress the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of \nreducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this \nis a significant, though not economically significant, regulatory \naction under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866.\n\n[[Page 25991]]\n\n    From 2016 to 2018, the average number of entrants for the DV \nProgram each year was 14,589,023. The Department estimates that, on \naverage, responding to this information request will take approximately \n5 minutes, which includes gathering the passport and supplying the \nnumber. This estimate does not account for the effort needed to acquire \na passport for those individuals who do not already have a passport, \nand the Department cannot provide a greater estimate of the time \nrequired to do that given the varied processes in foreign countries to \nobtain a passport. Using the average hourly wage for all private, non-\nfarm, payrolls as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for \nMarch 2019, $27.70 multiplied by a factor of 1.479 (to account for \noverhead costs) gives a fully-loaded wage of $40.97. Thus the \nopportunity costs associated with the time burden to supply the \ninformation for this collection are approximately $49,809,356. This \nburden does not account for the capital costs associated with acquiring \nthe passport for any individuals who do not already have one. The \nDepartment acknowledges that some portion of the applicant population \nwill need to procure a passport, but has no way of estimating how many \napplicants this would apply to and similarly does not have data \nindicating distributional impacts of this requirement. The benefits of \nenhancing the requirements to enter the DV Program, while difficult to \nquantify, will include reducing fraud and unauthorized entries on \nbehalf of unwitting individuals that could result in disqualifying the \nvictim.\n\nExecutive Orders 12372 and 13132: Federalism\n\n    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the \nStates, on the relationship between the national government and the \nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the \nvarious levels of government. The rule will not have federalism \nimplications warranting the application of Executive Orders 12372 and \n13132.\n\nExecutive Order 12988: Civil Justice Reform\n\n    The Department has reviewed the regulation in light of sections \n3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, \nminimize litigation, establish clear legal standards, and reduce \nburden.\n\nExecutive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    The Department has determined that this rulemaking will not have \ntribal implications, will not impose substantial direct compliance \ncosts on Indian tribal governments, and will not pre-empt tribal law. \nAccordingly, the requirements of Section 5 of Executive Order 13175 do \nnot apply to this rulemaking.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    The Department invites comment on any increase in burden imposed by \nthe proposed collection of information. Comments are encouraged and \nwill be accepted for 30 days from the publication date of the interim \nfinal rule. All submissions received must include the OMB Control \nNumber 1405-0153 in the body of the letter and the agency name.

Attention: Desk Officer for Department \nof State.\n\nAbstract of Proposed Collection\n\n    The Department of State utilizes the Electronic Diversity Visa \n(``EDV'') Entry Form to elicit information necessary to establish the \neligibility of the petitioner for the DV Program. The two primary \nrequirements of the program are: (1) The petitioner is a native of a \nlow admission country, and (2) has at least a high school education or \nits equivalent, or within five years of the date of an application for \na visa has two years of work experience in an occupation which requires \nat least two years of training or experience. This rule proposes to \namend the EDV Entry Form to require that entrants provide information \nfor a valid, unexpired passport. The Department of State randomly \nselects qualified entrants for further participation in the program.\n\nMethodology\n\n    The EDV Entry Form is available online at <a href=\"http://www.dvlottery.state.gov\">www.dvlottery.state.gov</a> \nand can only be submitted electronically during the annual entry \nperiod.\n\n<bullet> Title of Information Collection: Electronic Diversity Visa \nEntry Form\n<bullet> OMB Control Number: 1405-0153\n<bullet> Type of Request: Revision to a Currently Approved Collection\n<bullet> Originating Office: CA/VO/L/R\n<bullet> Form Number: DS-5501\n<bullet> Respondents: Electronic Diversity Visa Entry Form Respondents\n<bullet> Estimated Number of Respondents: 14,589,023\n<bullet> Estimated Number of Responses: 14,589,023\n<bullet> Average Time per Response: 35 minutes\n<bullet> Total Estimated Burden Time: 8,510,263 hours\n<bullet> Frequency: Annually\n<bullet> Obligation to Respond: Required to Obtain or Retain a Benefit\n\nList of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 42\n\n    Immigration; Passports and visas.\n\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Department amends 22 \nCFR part 42 as follows:\n\nPART 42--VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION \nAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED\n\n0\n1.
